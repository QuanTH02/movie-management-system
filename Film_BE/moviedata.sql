I\'m just going say #Reggierocks.\n\nSome great cinematography with lots of fab camera and drone work zooming around all over the place. The first person gun work at one point added a new dimension.\n\nMiami looks beautiful with the Orange and Teal tones.\n\nAction galore and a good protagonist in Eric Dane, although his motive and why he is doing what he is, was pretty rubbish, but he still played it well, and to be fair you don\'t come in to this sort of film hoping for Shakespeare level story telling.\n\nSome fun cameos pop up which raise a smile.\n\nThe soundtrack is good and Lorne Balfe delivers on the orchestrated score.\n\nIt has all you would expect from a Michael Bay production. Definitely life still in the franchise.'),(2,1,'8/10','\"You\'re my bad boys. Now clear my name.\"','jackransom-69832','5 June 2024','The fourth entry in the revitalised buddy cop, action, comedy franchise. Bad Boys: Ride or Die sees wisecracking Miami cops Mike Lowrey (Will Smith) and Marcus Burnett (Martin Lawrence) embark on a dangerous mission to clear the name of their late police captain when he gets linked to drug cartels.\n\nFirstly, they missed a trick not calling this instalment Bad Boys 4 Life, alas we cannot have everything we desire. Anyway, it was inevitable that we were going to get a fourth (and potentially fifth) as 2020\'s actual Bad Boys For Life made nearly half a billion dollars and due to the pandemic, was in the top 3 highest grossing of that year.\n\nIt has been too long since I watched the first film (it is long, long overdue a rewatch), however Bad Boys II I return to every couple of years when I require a dousing of Bayhem. Has it aged well? Nope. Is it obnoxious and overlong? Yes. Does the action rule? Hell yes! The third film I found solid, yet disappointing, it lacked the grit and sleaze of its predecessor and incorporated a bizarre supernatural element that didn\'t quite click.\n\nThis was a real step up from three and balances the slick, modernised lega-sequel of the previous film with the sleaze and chaos of Bay\'s entries. Admittedly it\'s a little bit of a rushed and rocky start and narratively the film isn\'t bringing anything particularly new to the table, yet it\'s clearly relishing its heightened mid-00\'s vibes. Once Marcus returns a from death\'s embrace with a new outlook on life and spirituality and Mike\'s fears for his family, his own mortality and a reconnection with his fugitive son come to the forefront of his anxieties, the film adds a surprising layer of character work that still manages to incorporate dick jokes and f-bombs aplenty.\n\nAction-wise this boasts some of the franchise\'s best set pieces. Director\'s Adil El Arbi & Bilall Fallah certainly lean a bit heavier into the Bayism\'s here than in BBFL. A slow-motion, sped up and gloriously chaotic digital, neon tinged art exhibition shootout is very Bay. A superb John Wick-esque home invasion shootout (featuring a well deserved triumphant moment for a fan favourite character) and the *entire* finale section of the film is a bar setter for shootouts this year. The incorporation of first person POVs, drones, alligators, explosions aplenty mix together for a riotous bloody blowout.\n\nPerformance-wise this was certainly the best way Will Smith could properly return after the Oscars controversy (I know he had Emancipation a few months after the incident, but I don\'t think anybody apart from me watched it). His more vulnerable and subdued fatherly moments as Mike are well executed... as well as the kick ass swagger that established the character. However, it\'s Martin Lawrence that steals the show. A motormouth, wide-eyed, born again foul mouthed spiritual guide who claims he can\'t die. He\'s having a ball and both he and Smith\'s chemistry is still unbeatable. Supporting players Jacob Scipio, Ioan Gruffudd, Rhea Seehorn and Reggie himself Dennis Greene are all locked in to the material.\n\nBad Boys: Ride or Die was a bullet riddled, cackle worthy blast of throwback fun that was a step up from my expectations. Smith & Lawrence are still a great duo, the action is killer and the balance of soap opera sincerity and over-the-top drama balances effectively with the motor-mouthed bickering and gags. Sure, the plot isn\'t particularly standout and the film is a little choppy in the first act, but when the wheels begin to fully spin, the film charges off the start line.'),(3,1,'8/10','Another Bad Boys banger','jtindahouse','5 June 2024','It must be a lot of fun to write these \'Bad Boys\' movies. The two lead characters really are great and they play off each other so well. And even if you wrote something in the script that was so-so, you know you\'ve got a couple of great actors who will make it work. There were a couple of lines in this movie where I thought to myself, on paper that probably wasn\'t all that funny, but they found a delivery that got a chuckle out of me.\n\nThere\'s everything you could want out of a \'Bad Boys\' movie in this one. The action is there, the laughs are there, there\'s a great menacing villain and there are some fun side characters to help carry the load. We are four movies into the series and have yet to see a drop-off in standard whatsoever. Bring on the next one I say. 8.5/10.\n60 out of 90 found this helpful. Was this review helpful?

But this movie feels like it has exhausted its last bit of entertainment without coming across as unnecessary. And that\'s a good thing.\n\nOut of the four Bad Boys movies so far, this was probably the one I enjoyed the most. It maybe also has to do with the fact that this was the first Bad Boys movie I\'ve watched in the big screen, naturally making the experience more exciting and memorable, but I also feel like the movie has a lot to make it likeable - be it the rather cliché but effective script, the callbacks, the action, the excitement and most of all, the amazing chemistry between Will Smith and Martin Lawrence.\n\nOverall, the movie is pretty fun and while not all jokes land, it\'s still decently funny and entertaining at the same time.\n18 out of 49 found this helpful.

The frequent and frantic action pieces are exciting and intense with enough explosions, violence and good use of clever camera work, constantly jumping between different views of the scenes. The characters are funny with plenty of jokes and humour as they make fun of themselves and each other whilst accepting they have aged.

More Martin Lawrence than the last one had which I really loved cause he was hilarious in this one too and so many types of jokes in this! Martin also had a really funny shootout scene involving food. Action was badass with the great choreography the last one had and more of that brutality too with bloody heavy hitting scenes, one scene I thought I was watching John Wick! There is probably one scene I wasn\'t keen on which is when someone has an out of body death experience, didn\'t match the grounded story. But the rest of the story was thrilling and connected to all the past bad boys films which I can appreciate it more for that, especially seeing the relationship between Mike and his son. Mike had some more character work with his panic attacks and even Marcus showing age and toll of the job they do. Final showdown was epic with tons of action with some really unique stuff to have fun with. Music they used too was really epic of course \"Bad Boys\" song but the song \"Tonight\" was really awesome and the use of those songs made it so much more amazing! Some really interesting camera angles especially during the final face off and as a wannabe cinematographer I appreciate them trying new things and seeing them work. It\'s good to see actors such as Rhea Seehorn, Eric Dane and Ioan Gruffudd in more roles too! There is also a Michael Bay cameo which was pretty cool!

Nothing more is to be anticipated.','fLick-IX','6 June 2024','Bad Boys: Ride or Die is a fun-fight entertainer with a predicted storyline. It would be incorrect to categorize this film as awful. Let\'s talk about it using the key components of a movie.\n\nDirection: Not too awful. It might have been better with more information regarding the character development, scene continuity, actor dialogue modulations, and setting.\n\nPlot: The plot of this film is weak. There are no enhancements over any of the prior stories or materials, and the plot itself is not new.\n\nScreenplay: It appears that there is no need to rewrite the screenplay for this film. It may have changed places, attire, and other equipment from the original script.\n\nDialogue: The dialogue in this film is informal and typical given the circumstances. A portion of them are useless.\n\nCinematography: This film emphasizes the use of cameras. Particularly in the action scenes. Not that awful, actually.\n\nActing: Will\'s entertaining dialogues aren\'t all that memorable, and his acting is lifeless. Several times, Martin has overacted. That could be the characterization, I don\'t know. However, something is absent.\n\nEditing: The hue and lighting aren\'t very appealing. VFX and blue screen are provided as usual. For the huge screen, some effects are quite unique. It\'s interesting to watch fight scenes with musical accompaniment.\n\nStunt: As long as there is minimal usage of blue screens, the stunts in this film are good.\n\nSoundtrack: It\'s alright. The stunt scenes\' background music is well-done.\n\nAttraction: To put it simply, the Bad Boys movie\'s entertainment value is \"okay.\" It is not a thrilling, suspenseful action film. A typical action movie, nothing noteworthy to say.'),(13,1,'7/10','You get what you come for','michvanbeek','7 June 2024','It\'s been four years since we were allowed to see the last Bad Boys film. To everyone\'s delay, Will Smith and Martin Lawrence returned as agents Mike Lowrey and Marcus Burnet. Of course, the first mentioned was discredited at the 2022 Oscar ceremony, after he sold actor Chris Rock a bang for his head after making a joke by his wife. Because the whole world spoke of shame about this, it became a bit quiet around Smith and he has done little more. This fourth Bad Boys film should give his career a big boost again and time will tell if the world has already forgiven Will Smith. In my case, I never blamed him for anything and I thought it was all very exaggerated how everyone reacted. I have always found Smith a good and above all nice actor and nothing has changed at all to date. The third Bad Boys For Life from 2020 is nice, but didn\'t manage to hit the level of the first two films, I expect the same from this fourth part and that\'s fine, because this will be a lot of action and humor where entertainment is guaranteed.\n\nAnd that\'s it, Bad Boys: Ride or Die gives exactly what you expect in advance and offers a tight two hours of pure popcorn entertainment. The film opens with a bickering Mike and Marcus. Marcus has to live healthier for his health, but when the two with screeching tires race across the highway, Marcus really wants to get something to drink. He gets 85 seconds, where Marcus seizes this moment to buy a hot dog and war Skittels within that time, but then the case is robbed. When Mike furiously walks into the case, a gun is immediately pointed at him, but Mike immediately starts whining at Marcus about his eating behavior. Bam! Opening film, something that immediately leaves its mark on the rest of the film. The gradient just fits perfectly with the predecessors and the directors on duty know how to make the course go as it should. Perhaps a point of criticism is the rather dynamic camera work. You may not really realize this at the beginning of the movie, but when the big action scenes come, it sometimes works disturbingly. Especially in the big end fight, where switching to a first person shooter mode, it looks rather cheap shooting. This was already shown in a making off, in which Smith controlled the image with his movements with a camera around his waist or on his arm.\n\nThe movie is really full of spectacular action and it\'s impossible for you to get bored. When Mike and Marcus try to purge the name of their deceased chief commissioner, they are forced to work with the captured Armando, son of Mike of course and bad guy in the previous film. Armando is the only one who can identify who is behind the plot. Unfortunately, the shoe is a bit pinching there, because although the writers may have tried to keep the story mysterious where the outcomes should amaze the viewer, the course and the outcome is very predictable and that is a shame. You will actually know quite quickly how or what in the \'trust no one\' cat-en-mouse game where you eventually get stuck with a \'see\' feeling. That\'s quite a shame, because this could perhaps have been prevented with some better writing, where you would still have a reasonable surprise to expect, but none of that. You actually see this very often in these kinds of films and of course you don\'t go there for a heavy plot twist where your mouth falls open, but here a very easy way is chosen to stay honest. Does that affect the film a lot for the rest? No, because as indicated earlier, you just get what you want and what you expect.\n\nBad Boys: Ride or Die is already the fourth film in the series and gives you as a viewer exactly what you expect from it. Will Smith and Martin Lawrence are the bickering police duo again and end up in an explosive situation again. Perhaps a little more attention should have been paid to the story itself, because that is very predictable, but well, because you are constantly entertained, a large part of the audience will be a concern. However, the camera work is sometimes just a little too dynamic, making some things difficult to follow. For the rest, this is just popcorn entertainment from the top shelf and as mentioned you just get what you come for, a lot of fun humor with action, action and more action. If the Belgian directors Bilall Fallah and Adil El Arbi continue to do this, they can still make a few films, because this is just wonderful set your mind on blanc and just watch and enjoy without fuss or other difficult hassle.'),(14,1,'6/10','It\'s allright...','imseeg','8 June 2024','Nothing really new (besides a few fun drone action scenes), nothing really surprising (besides a Martin Lawrence thinking he is invincible after having seen a vision), but just another well made sequel...\n\nThe good: 2 guys goofing around, we know the drill, we know their chemistry and it still works. Especially Martin Lawrence\'s dialogues are quite funny. Fans of the earlier versions will be getting what they wished for, although dont expect fireworks, it\'s more of the same, but executed rather well...\n\nAny bad?

It retains a lot of the positive things which have made the past films fun such as impactful action, R rated jokes and family dynamics. That came with a bunch of side characters new and old and an okay plot but there is one thing that lets this movie down and it\'s Martin Lawrence\'s character, Marcus Burnett.\n\nUnfortunately, it\'s becoming all too common in Hollywood for a character to be so over the top for a movie that it just becomes distracting.\n\nAfter surviving a near death experience at the beginning of the film, Marcus is high on life and he literally acts as if he is high for the rest of the film. This went beyond fun and playful to the point where it was distracting and annoying. It led to many frustrating scenes which felt like they belonged in a cartoon including one scene where the characters chose one of the worst possible moments to sing the Bad Boys theme.\n\nIn the End, Bad Boys Ride or Die is a frustrating but okay film which could have been much better with different narrative choices although many people might enjoy the direction that the film went.'),(17,1,'8/10','Offers nothing new but still fun....','marwinsingh-30063','7 June 2024','Bad Boys is one of the best buddy em cop action comedy franchise and with 4th part it looks like they\'ve run their course.

There are some good action scenes in this movies mostly consists of shootouts ,I think 2nd one has the best action sequences because that was directed by Michael Bay who is known for making big scale action pieces, after some time you\'ll get bored seeing same action again and again but it was still very fun to see on big screen especially the FPS gun scene during climax.. Cinematography consisting of Skylines shots of Miami was cool to see, soundtrack was good and acting of man leads was the best part of movie...

Regarding the story, compared to Bad Boys for Life, it was of a lower level because it didn\'t have many surprises and twists like the previous one. And regarding the screenplay, the previous movie had a better screenplay than this one because the scenario and the order of events and how they are presented was a lot better, and cought the attention of the person who is watching more.\n\nBut this does not mean that I didn\'t like Bad Boys: Ride or Die.

The shots used in this movie are amazing like there\'s 1st person and drone shot scenes that are great. Will smith and Martin Lawrence were so funny and had perfect chemistry throughout. There was a full roster of characters it felt like fast and furious in that way. The villain lacks he\'s not very interesting but has some cool scenes. I like how the plot of there old captain dying and they need to find out what happened. The suspense with finding out who the rat was was cool. The pacing is great there\'s great action throughout. The 3rd act was epic with great action and was better than I thought it was ganna to be. Overall I loved it it\'s a great time in the theater, mid to high 8.\n3 out of 13 found this helpful.

Well sort of anyway...\"\n\nI really really wanted to love Furiosa but in the end I didn\'t, I liked it but didn\'t love it. Big big shoes to fill, I completely love Fury Road - a perfect action film in every way, so I was prepared to have this film fall in its shadow. Which it did. Furiosa is fun but its sadly no FR.\n\nThe good news: You want action? There is action, loads of it. Like any good Mad Max story it holds true to its promise to entertain the masses with spectacle. Glorious. We get the hot rods, big wheels, diggers, bikes of all shapes and sizes, as well as flying contraptions, weaponry galore and no holding back on the violence. Explosions, bodies flying, witness me etc. Plenty. It can be brutal and nasty but true to form and true to Mad Max. What more do you want?\n\nCasting is good, perhaps a few too many characters leaving each of them to have not quite enough to do especially with Immortan Joe\'s followers. Anja Taylor Joy is good as Furiosa and Hemsworth seems to really be enjoying himself. Dementus is a great villain, a sort of love child of Immortan Joe and The Humungus; the presence, the wee speeches, his villainy is fun. And he gets to be very Aussie no need to hide that accent. I also liked a younger and much cleverer Immortan Joe; in this film he\'s not the core bad guy and without the need to get his 5 wives back as a motivator making him crazy we get to see him as the warlord he is. Smart and patient and in control.\n\nAnd there\'s world building! Which was very cool. We got to see more of the Wasteland and get hints of how it ticks and what made it so.\n\nThe bad news: Visually Furiosa is a bit of a mixed bag; sometimes we get stuff worthy of its predecessor and other times we get stuff that is... less so. The colour is much more pale than the richness of FR and the cinematography is no where near the standards. Occasionally the CGI lets the film down just a bit. In Fury Road you got the impression that it was almost all practical effects even if it wasn\'t. In Furiosa there are sequences where I went... \'eww, yikes\' as the standards of the film dropped. Only a few moments but be prepared.\n\nThe music is often absent or very lacking. The sweeping epics of Fury Road are almost gone instead we get much more background stuff or even sadly largely silent action sequences. This leads to a lack of tension, nothing edge of your seat here.\n\nThe writing and edit isn\'t great. The characters lack spark and bits feel missing. Miller is trying to tell a story but seems unsure of how to write characters in which one can invest. Furiosa has more ambition in its story telling and I think its execution is lacking. The core story solid but it seems a bit empty on the screen. The film jumps at times skipping over character development worthy of exploration.\n\nIn the edit i really really missed the fast cuts of Fury where Miller really built his scenes through tight production and cuts and edits where everything builds beautifully and leads to a great conclusions. Miller did this scene after scene in FR whereas in Furiosa its really lacking. Means theres not as much tension, not as many \'that was close\' nor \'that was amazing\' moments.\n\nOverall I did like it. Furiosa is a good Mad Max film but its no Fury Road. I\'d be surprised if the film is recognized at Oscar time, where Fury Road won 6 Furiosa might get a nomination or two in the technical but no nominations for Directing or Best Picture.\n\nBy my deeds I honour him...\n\nBy my wallet I honour George Miller, Witness Furiosa.

Its a shame because it makes you leave the theaters with a bad taste for a pretty good movie.\n\nActors were decent, script decent, action decent, green screen decent (but could been better), story line decent (except ending).\n\nAll by all 7out of 10.'),(25,2,'9/10','15 years of Wasteland','masonsaul','25 May 2024','It would be folly to try and outdo Fury Road and Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga is smart enough to not even attempt that. It\'s a completely different film in its structure which allows it to be a prequel that tells a complete story on its own whilst still enhancing Fury Road with its world building. The fact that George Miller is still telling stories in the wasteland at this scale is a real gift.\n\nAlyla Brown gets a lot more screen time than child versions of pre-established characters usually get and with next to no dialogue she is superb at communicating everything without words. Carrying that on for the second half, Anya Taylor-Joy does a phenomenal job and was right to fight to keep the scream in. If you need someone to act exclusively with their eyes, she is as perfect as they come.\n\nChris Hemsworth is clearly relishing the opportunity to play a properly mad villain with Dementus and has so many chill inducing moments. This is easily the best he\'s been so far, completely unhinged with just enough depth to explain everything he does. He\'s a complicated figure who always seeks power but is never able to truly hold onto it.\n\nGeorge Miller truly is a genius when it comes to exploring this franchise. Getting to see a fully realised Gas Town and Bullet Farm allows this world to cohere like never before and the action crafted here is so epic with gorgeous imagery that refuses to slow down. Just like John Seale achieved last time, Simon Duggans\'s cinematography can keep the action clean no matter what\'s thrown at it.\n\nIt makes sense that the only way Tom Holkenborg could come close to his best work on Fury Road was to return to the wasteland and his score here continues to compliment the kineticism of the action so well. The only downside is the CGI which looks pretty bad at various points and stands out further because of how well Fury Road implemented it.'),(26,2,'9/10','This is what action is....','kanhalangsycamden','25 May 2024','I feel many go into Furiosa expecting a Mad max movie, and at its core it is so much different. With its predecessor being Fury road, Furiosa had a very high bar to achieve. However, these 2 movies are so different, while they may seem similar they are completely different action movies. Furiosa takes on a much more different aesthetic with the use of slightly more darker and less vibrant colors, a much different protagonist, and a more complex story. The use of cgi is pretty disappointing, if you have a keen eye you can pretty easily the digital doubles and green screen. Anya Taylor-Joy gives an absolutely amazing performance. Dare I say she is better than Charlize Theron in Fury Road? Absolutely! Chris Hemsworth was also great and hilarious. Furiosa, while it may have many flaws, is one of the best action movies to come out in recent times, and I hope it gets the recognition it deserves. Furiosa is in no ways perfect, but do I love it? Yes.\n135 out of 224 found this helpful. Was this review helpful?

After the incredible cinematography magic that genius John Seale weaved, Furiosa felt just like some lacklustre adaptation of a far superior source material.\n\nOnly thing I found charming was the overall 80\'s feel, resembling the style of a Road Warrior, and some scenes feel like they were recreated straight from the original trilogy. While action sequences are, as expected, top notch, the epic sense of awe and sheer crazy excitement that ludicrous stunts and choreography brought us in Fury Road was lacking. Editing was sometimes atrocious. Even in the best action or \"poignant\" scenes this movie had to offer, I never felt that I\'m watching it from the edge of my seat, nor did I get emotionally involved with any of characters.\n\nSpeaking of which, acting was fairly wooden, lines declamatory delivered, the script overall seemed recycled and overly done, bordering on boring. Storytelling was chaotic, rushed and dragged at the same time. Sometimes the unnecessary narrator helped things to move along, unfortunately in a bad way.\n\nBut the major flaw was that there was no hero\'s journey for any of characters. Furiosa is the same person at the beginning as she is at the end of a movie, same as Dementus. Remember Nux and his journey? There is nothing like it in Furiosa. Furthermore, Furiosa endures every hardship with the same fierce look in her eyes - we never see pain, never fear, never doubt. She shrugs any injury off, like a terminator. It was hard to get emotionally involved with her character. Unfortunately, she came across as a classic girl boss, amazing in everything she does from the start to the finish, as a kid, and as an adult. Relationship between Furiosa and Praetorian Jack is so robotic and unemotional it\'s painful to watch. Dementus\'s monologue at the end was a snoozefest. All in all, I witnessed it, and found it mediocre.'),(30,2,'9/10','Very good storyline','shamileliyev','25 May 2024','\"Furiosa\" is an exhilarating addition to the Mad Max franchise that masterfully blends intense action, compelling storytelling, and stunning visuals. Director George Miller returns with his signature style, delivering a prequel that not only lives up to the high standards set by \"Mad Max: Fury Road\" but also expands the lore in fascinating ways.\n\nAnya Taylor-Joy shines in the titular role, bringing both ferocity and depth to Furiosa\'s character. Her performance is nuanced, capturing the raw survival instinct and emotional complexity of a young woman navigating a brutal, post-apocalyptic world. The supporting cast is equally impressive, with standout performances that add layers to the narrative and enrich the overall experience.\n\nThe film\'s action sequences are nothing short of spectacular. Miller\'s direction ensures that every chase, fight, and explosion is not only thrilling but also coherent and impactful. The practical effects and stunts are awe-inspiring, creating a visceral experience that keeps you on the edge of your seat.\n\nVisually, \"Furiosa\" is a masterpiece. The cinematography and production design transport viewers to a desolate yet strangely beautiful wasteland, where every frame is meticulously crafted to immerse the audience fully. The score, too, complements the film perfectly, enhancing the tension and emotional beats with its powerful compositions.\n\nBeyond the action, \"Furiosa\" offers a compelling story of resilience, rebellion, and redemption. It delves into the origins of one of the franchise\'s most iconic characters, providing a rich backstory that fans will find deeply satisfying. The film balances its high-octane sequences with moments of genuine character development and emotional resonance.\n\nOverall, \"Furiosa\" is a triumphant return to the world of Mad Max.

The look is off everything from camerawork to editing to the costumes to vehicles to action scenes. Loads of bad CGI replaces the high octane realistic crazy stunts and motor mayhem from fury road. It all looks shot in a studio with fake everything. Big drop in quality and a sense of realism.\n\nIt\'s sad to see that Miller has settled for the studio instead of real vehicles in real environments with neck breaking stunts. Both clothes and vehicles just looks very designed now as well instead of a somewhat believable mishmash of what can be found in the wastelands. It\'s also a-lot cleaner in every way, vehicles look shiny and newly made. It just feels more censored and less naked and rough.\n\nThe story surprises nobody and is pretty much exactly what you expect. Void from a lot of the epic action scenes you might have to expect after fury road. You get some decent action but Fury Road is the gold standard here and this is not even close. Look and feels more like a cookie cutter action movie set in the Mad Max universe. Had I have to guess without knowing it I would never have guessed that Miller directed this.

I admire it as an action vehicle but as a movie overall it just really leaves me wanting. I\'ve thought this for years but it only really got confirmed to me once it rewatched it the day before I finally saw this movie. The fact that this movie was supposed to be so different from Fury Road was quite appealing to me going in since I don\'t totally gel with that movie and overall I\'m amazed by how much I enjoyed it given my somewhat mixed feelings on the predecessor.\n\nI think where this film succeeds for me compared to Fury Road is that it does takes its time more. There\'s considerably more world building and moments to breathe between the action scenes. In Fury Road this was very much absent by design but I loved the fact that Miller took a different approach here. I really liked the gradually pace this film took and how it fleshed out this surprisingly interesting world. The one thing I can\'t deny about Fury Road is how incredible the action scenes are and that\'s no different here. I think the big difference for me is that there\'s more build up to them and as such I thought there were more stakes going into them. They\'re long and jaw dropping in scale and it really does give me an urge to finally watch the original films.\n\nThe performances and character work are also top notch and I really appreciate the fact that those are things George Miller doesn\'t skimp on in his action movies. Anya Taylor-Joy is basically perfect as Furiosa and obviously she\'s going to be compared with Charlize Theron but ultimately I think both of their portrayals compliment each other very well. While her arc does follow a template we\'ve seen before I ultimately thought it worked very well and I was always interested what action she was going to take next. A big credit for that has to go to Chris Hemsworth who is outstanding and this is easily the best performance I\'ve ever seen him give. He\'s not the deepest villain I\'ve ever seen but\'s he\'s very memorable and Hemsworth gives such an entertaining performance that I just always wanted to see more of him on screen. Tom Burke was also great in a role that I thought was surprisingly wholesome but also quite mysterious in all the right ways.\n\nThe story itself though is definitely where the film falters the most for me though. It\'s split up into very distinctive chapters and in many ways I liked that about it but it also hurt the pacing somewhat. It felt as if the film had to keep re-starting with every new chapter and for as jaw dropping as the action scenes are their length became a bit tiring since the story is so bare bones. I also think the actual ending could\'ve been stronger given that it very much leads directly into Fury Road and the transformation of the Furiosa here into the one in that film didn\'t feel entirety earned to me.\n\nI had no idea what to expect going into Furiosa but I was so pleasantly surprised by how much I enjoyed it. It feels like such a natural expansion of the world set up by Fury Road and the character work is surprisingly very strong. It definitely has its weaker aspects but as someone who\'s not the biggest fan of the predecessor I really appreciated how this movie gave me more than I could\'ve possibly expected.'),(36,2,'10/10','FURIOSA is a GOLD PLAQUE of the YEAR with HIGH ON ACTION','kmkevinn-64733','15 May 2024','In the desolate yet visually stunning landscape of George Miller\'s latest masterpiece, \"Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga,\" the audience is thrust into a maelstrom of high-octane action and profound storytelling. This prequel to the critically acclaimed \"Mad Max: Fury Road\" not only expands the lore of the titular character but also redefines the boundaries of the action genre. Anya Taylor-Joy had 30 lines of dialogue that delivers a tour-de-force performance as Furiosa, embodying the character with a fierce determination and emotional depth that captivates from the first frame. Chris Hemsworth\'s portrayal of the villainous Dementus is both charismatic and menacing, providing a perfect foil to Furiosa\'s heroism. George Miller\'s direction after watching FURY ROAD is nothing short of masterful & beautiful creations of what road action is really like; he crafts a narrative that is both expansive and intimate, with each set piece surpassing the last in scale and spectacle. The cinematography is a character in itself, painting the Wasteland of \"WHAT A LOVELY DAY\" with a palette that is as beautiful as it is desolate.\n\n\"Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga\" is a testament to the power of myth-making. It\'s a film that not only honors its predecessors but also stands on its own as a monumental achievement in cinema.

That being said, it\'s night and day when you compare the two. I\'m a huge fan of the last one, the spectacle and action make it one of the best films of all time imo, and it\'s clear they tried to recreate that with this movie, but for me it falls flat. Most, if not all, action sequences are all CGI, it\'s good CGI, but you can absolutely tell it\'s CG. There are lots of times in the movie where it straight up just looks out of a video game. I get where this comes from, the shots they go for are definitely a bit more ambitious, but it\'s lacking the chunky and gritty realism of the last film. The action can seem floaty and overly ragdolly at times because of this. Regardless, this isn\'t my biggest complaint with the movie, my biggest is the story. There are times when things just happen for no good reason at all, in an effort to avoid spoilers, I won\'t list them, but they are painstakingly obvious. For example, an integral character gets killed and it seems to be of zero consequence to one of the characters, even though the movie spends some time trying this half baked romance. I also just couldn\'t get into Anya Taylor-Joy as furiousa, maybe it\'s just a me thing, but she just doesn\'t really fit the gritty role she\'s meant to play. Chis Hemsworth is a standout performance though, although I do think, again, the writing for his character is a bit garbage.

Discovering the cause of the heroine\'s father\'s death is the main goal of the film. It\'s a completely bad film. From the outset, it presents a quiet atmosphere in a desolate setting with few actors. It\'s like an inexperienced director took a nonsense script and cast it. Even with a bad screenplay, these kinds of thrillers ought to have better acting. Jessica doesn\'t even know how to hold a knife correctly in this film.

Movies today, from the sprawling epics of \"Dune\" to the interconnected sagas of the MCU, seem to require a viewer\'s full dedication-and maybe even a notepad to keep up. This isn\'t to diminish their artistry, but it\'s clear that the pure joy of cinema, the sort of effortless fun Hollywood once peddled so well, has become a rare find. A film that welcomes you without prerequisites, \"The Fall Guy,\" seeks to reignite that spark of unadulterated entertainment. It aims to dazzle with the sheer magnetism of its leads, thrust into a whirlwind of romance and adventure, harking back to the days when stunts were real and filmmaking was a team sport, offering a joyride that\'s as heartwarming as it is thrilling.\n\nHollywood\'s narrative-rich turn hasn\'t dulled the magic of star power, a fact \"The Fall Guy\" embraces wholeheartedly, reminiscent of a time when the charm of icons like Burt Reynolds was all the spectacle one needed. Ryan Gosling proves his mettle as a jack-of-all-trades, winning hearts even in the most casual settings, his performance in this film further cementing his versatile appeal.\n\n\"The Fall Guy\" also champions the unsung heroes of cinema: the stunt performers. Through breathtaking feats and daredevil escapades, it pays homage to the risk-takers who\'ve silently shaped cinematic history, although it\'s not without its critiques, especially in how it sidelines some of its stellar cast in the latter half.\n\nYet, beyond the adrenaline, there\'s a poignant commentary on the digital age\'s challenges to authenticity, making \"The Fall Guy\" a vibrant counterpoint to the prevailing trends of faceless, CGI-dominated blockbusters. It\'s a film that doesn\'t just want to entertain; it wants to remind us of the value of genuine connection, both on the screen and in the stunts that make us hold our breath. In doing so, it doesn\'t just invite audiences to have fun; it demands it, championing the kind of cinema that\'s been overshadowed by the gravitas of today\'s tentpoles.'),(68,4,'6/10','Thin plot strung over some excellent stunt work','timothywalton-31924','25 April 2024','The Fall Guy acts best as a glorious ode to the art of stunt work. Perhaps never before have a film been focused so much on the unseen heroes behind many great films - the stunt doubles delivering shockingly realistic portrayals of the action. And in that respect The Fall Guys succeeds- it\'s action sequences are delivered flawlessly, and are breathtaking to behold. They climax to a crescendo at the ending, where a several vehicles crash, flip and explode, all in sync with action involving a helicopter in the sky with our main character. Praise should also be given to the films two charismatic leads. Emily Blunt and Ryan Gosling share palpable chemistry and are simply endearing to behold. They are affable, amiable, and funny. But ultimately my problem with this film is that it is unevenly paced, lacks enough humour, and has too thin a plot to retain an audiences full attention. The films firstly takes too long to get its plot started, resulting in a laborious introduction, a sped through mid section, and a bombastic but slightly rushed ending. The film also does not exert its full potential of comedy. The film does not make use of action comedy(as best exemplified by the Jackie Chan films) or a particularly witty script. Indeed the script is rather dull, sometimes trite, and altogether not very sharp or exciting. Then there is the films plot. I can comment not much other than that it is the recyclable convoluted B-grade plots which are common in movies. It is predictable, ludicrous, and quite inexcusable. So at the end of the day, The Fall Guys is a good comedy that acts as a wonderful tribute to the art of stunt work, bolstered by strong, effervescent performances between its two leads.

This is a love letter to the stunt team, a film dedicated to showing the grittiness and the roughness of the industry and how the movie industry will fall apart without them. Not only that, this is also a film for anyone who loves films or filmmaking in general.\n\nJust like how Barbie was meta for the toy industry, The Fall Guy is meta for the filmmaking industry. Plenty of subtle and hidden messages that were incorporated in the script. Ex: There was one scene that spontaneously mentioned on how the stunt team didn\'t get any recognition at the Oscars. There was even distinct mentions or references of Taylor Swift, Dune, Kill Bill and Miami Vice amongst many others. Plenty were about the movie industry that if you spotted those things, you would truly have a good time in the cinemas.\n\nMarketed as an action rom-com, this film didn\'t fill its promise with the comedy. It\'s an element that\'s just lacking from beginning \'til the end. Of course, it wasn\'t empty, it had its moments but for a comedy film, it didn\'t achieve the bar it was supposed to. You might be smiling or left out a few chuckles, but they weren\'t anything that were just worth bursting out loud. Again, comedy is extremely subjective.\n\nThe Fall Guy did very well the first 30 minutes of the film. Everything you wanted it to be was conveyed really well. David Leitch opened the film about a film who\'s working for that film. It fully maximizes everything exciting regarding this subject. The main focus was about filmmaking and the stunt community. It shed light on these unsung heroes, showcasing their dedication and talent in bringing action-packed scenes to life. And damn, it is very good and entertaining.\n\nWhen the second act came in, we started to lose a bit of interest in this movie. Mainly due to its shift of focus that it somehow turned into a murder mystery genre. First act was very good that it talked a lot on filmmaking, and almost every scene was located in a production set. The dialogues were also heavy on that. But the middle part focused more on the murder mystery and romance. While they still included a lot of the meta elements here but they turned its way into a more generic film when it could have been so much more.\n\nEven most of the dialogues during the romance scenes were just not as good as the rest of the script. They just didn\'t maximize the stuff they were talking about. Some dialogues felt meaningless. Some were just flat out boring. Some have meanings but if only they could polish them, this movie would have been so much better.\n\nLuckily, Ryan Gosling and Emily Blunt sparked a good chemistry on set. Even with a moment of no dialogues, just when they\'re looking at each other, you\'ll know well enough their chemistry is just electrifyingly good. There were moments they weren\'t physically together, but the film showed them on a split screen and etc. But the palpable connection between them remained strong.\n\nThe movie redeems itself at the third act. It\'s a very epic ending and you rarely see this kind of ending in an action rom-com movie. The action and the scope were big and the messages were all very on-point with the whole theme of the film. It\'s bombastic but it\'s lovely at the same time. It\'s less on fighting or punching, but more on the performing of stunts. 2-3 scenes felt and looked like they came straight out from old classic films. There\'s just a certain way that the ending was shot that it gave a homage to old action movies. It\'s indeed a sight to behold.\n\nVerdict: A love letter to the unsung heroes, The Fall Guy pays homage to the stunt community, exploring their hardships behind the scenes through the lens of both a director and a stuntman. While it falls short on delivering promised comedy, its first act shines with interesting filmmaking commentary. Despite a weak second act, strong chemistry between Ryan Gosling and Emily Blunt along with an epic finale elevate the film, delivering a visually stunning tribute to classic cinema.\n\nP.

If David Leitch and 87 North did all the action in cinema the world would be a better place.\n\nRyan Gosling achieves new levels of perfection by merging the reserved stunt man character of Drive with his natural Kenergy. His version of Colt is just so lovable, especially because he\'s completely unafraid to be open in his vulnerability which makes him more relatable whilst being really funny. His comedic timing continues to be faultless, proving he can make any joke land.\n\nEmily Blunt thankfully also gets a lot to do. Any scene she shares with Gosling is effortlessly charming and she has her own brand of bona-fide movie star charisma. Winston Duke is a great movie referencing support to Gosling, Aaron Taylor-Johnson does a hilarious McConaughey impression and Hannah Waddingham\'s cartoonishly over the top producer really works.\n\nDavid Leitch\'s direction plays squarely to his strengths and after the disappointment of The Gray Man, it\'s extra satisfying to see Gosling be given some actually good fight scenes.

While Gosling\'s portrayal adds depth and charisma, the movie suffers from a disjointed plot that leaves viewers with unanswered questions and moments that feel unnecessary.\n\nOne of the film\'s shortcomings lies in its lack of clarity and connection to the central plot, leading to confusing scenes that detract from the overall narrative coherence. Emily Blunt, despite her talent, is constrained by underdeveloped scripting for her character, Jody, resulting in a relationship dynamic with Gosling\'s character, Colt, that lacks believability and depth. The imbalance in character development creates a sense of manipulation and blame within their relationship, which undermines the emotional connection the film tries to establish.\n\nNevertheless, The Fall Guy does have its bright spots, with humorous scenes, witty lines, and commendable performances from supporting actors Aaron Tyler-Johnson as Tom and Hannah Waddingham as Gail, who bring life to their villainous roles.\n\nUltimately, while Ryan Gosling\'s performance shines, The Fall Guy struggles to fully engage me as an audience due to its weak storyline and character dynamics.'),(81,4,'6/10','All over the place and misses the mark','Kingslaay','26 May 2024','I had some hopes for The Fall Guy but it felt like they decided on one storyline and changed their mind partway through and pursued another plot.

Alex Garland has offered us a vaccintion for what ails us. Like a serum for snake bite made of venom itself, this film grabs us by the shoulders and screams \"You got a civil war fantasy? Fine, I\'ll put it on a 40 foot screen and dare you to cheer.\"\n\nCivil War finds it\'s foundational vision in the eyes of those who for decades have brought us the soul shattering reality of war, free from the romance of Hollywood patriotism- war journalists whose frenzied, conflicted oddysey plunges them into a mad gauntlet of fire and film, killing and kodachrome. Like soldiers in a war of attrition, they must constantly reassess the purpose of thier risks and sacrifices as they watch their colleagues fall for the sake of the priceless pictoral story of war. Three generations of war correspondants traveling together into the insanity becomes the testiment to three phases in the life of such a calling.\n\nWe are introduced to the strangeness of how soldiers, out for blood, tolerate and facilitate the prescence of these unarmored observers every step of the way through the hell of combat. Garland seems to tap into some unspoken ethos of universal creedance among combatants that the history of it all must be seen and those who record it must survive to tell of it. It is never explained, merely displayed.\n\nWe are reminded that in a modern Americn civil war, rogue atrocity can roll through your city just as easy as it did for My Lai. If you think that in the fog of war we would maintain our civility and morality like gentlemen, think again. For every five patriots there might be one psychopath ready to fill ditches with the innocent dead executed under the jurisprudence of a few unhinged men with guns.\n\nWe have no idea why this war is being fought. Perhaps it is a just war. Perhaps it is a crazed cessationist rebellion. We aren\'t afforded such information. It would only get in the way of the vital message-war is hell and be careful when you tell your fellow American to go to hell for thier political differences. What you end up with might be far darker and damning than you ever dreamed.\n\nThe genius of this film rests partially in an absurd alliance between California and Texas, two of the most opposite states in the Union. By joining this ideological odd couple, the story immunizes itself against accusations of partisanship or cultural favortism. Yet it also beckons us to imagine what kind of national crisis could bring such opposites together.\n\nThis film will be awarded there is no doubt. Alex Garland has broken new ground and his script and actors and cinemetography deserve all the awards they get.'),(108,6,'10/10','Former FBI Agent persoective: one of the most important films in history','ramair350','13 April 2024','Everybody should see this film. No spoilers, but it is a glimpse into what life could be like in a modern American civil war. Indeed, there is nothing civil about war. It is a terrifying film to me, primarily since it is a future that is possible. Not probable, but not a giant leap either. Collapse of government happens quickly. Just ask a former Soviet citizen.\n\nThe film is captivating and intense. The couple next to me in the theater walked out 20 minutes in due to the violence. Guess what: that is what war is. The film does not glorify war; indeed, it is quite anti-war. There are times where war unfortunately is necessary.

Unfortunately, there is zero background information. This is a movie about war correspondents . . . That\'s it. It\'s not \"an American tale\" or anything special in terms of impact. It\'s just a very well done war movie, with bad guys and good guys, and they can be from either side of the political spectrum. I found it pretty, well-shot and production design is great as well. But I found it hollow, without the detail that I would have liked to have seen about the two sides. I think that Garland didn\'t focus on any of that because he didn\'t want to be accused of picking a side. But without it. It\'s simply a movie about people shooting guns. Lots of loud noises and explosions, and the (interesting) character development of a set of photo journalists.\n212 out of 335 found this helpful. Was this review helpful?

The movie also tries to comment on war journalism by presenting us with the dangers faced by journalists, but makes the main protagonist incredibly stupid just asking to get shot. She seems to actively want to die, and aims to take every down with her. However when the movie presented me with an action scene I was stunned. The Visuals and Audio were phenomenal. The Action scenes were done incredibly but my only wish was that the main characters weren\'t in them. In the end I was entertained, but disappointed.\n129 out of 201 found this helpful.

As for the rest, it\'s not terrible. To say it\'s formulaic doesn\'t take things much further because what isn\'t these days. There\'s no actual plot but that\'s also allowed lately. It\'s a bit odd that there\'s no explanation at all about how the USA has found itself in a civil war or as to why the president is ultimately portrayed as such an unsympathetic character but that is ok too since it\'s really all about the journey of the central characters. As to those characters, they\'re somewhat stereotypical. You\'ve got the photo hack who\'s seen all the horrors of war ( in case we didn\'t get this we are shown a sequence of her reminiscences) there\'s the ingenue and, as is normal, the hero\'s reluctance to take her on board and the usual mix of support. In the end you have the new girl getting on with business and proving that she\'s the real deal. If the characters are a bit cliche\'d, the dialogue hardly helps with lines like (I\'m paraphrasing because I can\'t recall exactly but something like) \"I\'ve never felt so scared in my life, but I\'ve never felt more alive\". It\'s a bit like a mixture between Watership Down and Apocalypse Now except it really doesn\'t match up to either of those.'),(113,6,'10/10','Masterpiece about war journalism. A phenomenal Kirsten Dunst','aceshop3','6 April 2024','Let me start with: the discourse around this film is truly fascinating-and I think it\'s incredible to read this some time after watching the movie. The trailers were kind of awful marketing imo. This is a character-driven story, but in the most tense way possible. Anything can happen at any moment, and the left swerves are constant. I have to stress that OH MY GOD you have to see this on the big screen! It\'s one of the most immersive films I\'ve ever seen-I wasn\'t pulled out of it for even a second and it is so bloody beautiful!\n\nI should not have loved this movie, but I did, because it has some truly wild universal implications-it\'s not limited to the US at all. I had to take a long time to process this film, but I understand the breathless first reactions: this is not like anything I\'ve seen before, for one particular reason. I also totally get the Apocalypse Now comparisons: now there\'s another film that contradicted each impulse it put out. One might say that by nullifying itself it too was \"empty\"-but of course it wasn\'t. This movie is pretty meta: what I think and say will say a lot about me and how I see the world. That\'s super cool! But it\'s not about war (outside of being an anti-war film). It\'s about war journalism, and spectacle.\n\nA lack of context might annoy people. And why? Well, frankly, because this is a movie that is opposed to American exceptionalism. It aggressively shoves your face in its sameness actually. It renders it banal; a war zone like any other country in another war film where most American viewers likely have little idea of the opposing parties or actors involved. Every gun shot is loud as hell, every explosion is far too much: spectacle, yes, and people ask \"to what end?\" I find it radical. One can make up five different backstories of how Texas and California seceded separately and then allied against a fascist President: but the only reason you\'d have a problem with the fact that Civil War doesn\'t tell you is because you\'re too attached to the American-ness of it all. America? Depicted like any other? The cheek! Jesse Plemons\' character heavily evokes the Khmer Rouge. There\'s so many other examples-they remind you of somewhere else (Vietcong references, Afghanistan/Iraq imagery, less domestic parallels than international ones tbh). I admire the provocation to us Americans, I really do. This film is about the spectacle of war and how it would look today: literally any war, anywhere, and here! And it\'s using the most provocative, iconic setting to do that.\n\nThe performances are OFF THE WALL. Dunst is phenomenal, she\'s the whole-ass movie! We\'ve literally never seen this from her before, and damn, that range. One doesn\'t doubt her as Lee, a veteran war photographer, for a moment, even though she barely says anything. It\'s saying a lot that this is up there amongst her best work. Hell, it\'s one of the best performances of this whole decade. The whole movie plays out through her reactions and tonally she\'s pitched it perfectly. And Wagner Moura is almost equally brilliant (it could reasonably be considered a co-lead performance imo): his Joel is chaotic, wild, and hedonistic. The depiction of war journalists is so precise: the bizarre, adrenaline-fueling addiction that it seems to require. It\'s devastating. The film explores the ethics of reporting: where it ends is not stated, but it is clear. In Moura\'s scream, in Dunst\'s eyes, in Stephen McKinley Henderson\'s beautifully wise tone, and then in Spaeny\'s reverse-mirroring her idol\'s journey. The score was appropriately surreal, the needle-drops brilliant (deep cuts!), all the techs are undeniably in sync. None of this would\'ve worked without this ensemble, and Dunst in particular. They\'re not just the characters: they\'re the whole point of the film.\n\nOne might ask: How stupid does Alex Garland have to be to make a film so pointedly open to all the criticism? He knows people will call it \"empty\", lacking in a \"political stance.\" He knows people will find it bombastic, or that because we\'re thrown into the deep end, no amount of character shading and performance work will prevent people from saying things like \"thin characterization\". But Lee, Joel & Sammy (McKinley Henderson) are razor-sharp. Jessie (Spaeny) is the real enigma. I think for Garland, this setting was the only vehicle through which there might be an actual jolt, and he wasn\'t wrong. The setting is familiar *globally*: what better setting to choose than the icons of a global superpower most people in the world are familiar with? This might seem like a step too far as comparison but people across the world were just as shocked as anyone when the towers went down on 9/11. Why? Because they wondered: it could happen there too? Really?! Garland\'s somehow made a film that feels real enough to evoke that shock.\n\nI kept thinking with every second I would soon say it\'s exploitative. But this movie doesn\'t allow any feel-good triumphalism. It\'s dark & terrifying. This is the sheer dread and despair of war: there is no questioning that the film is staunchly anti-war: the cost of it all feels so palpable. The aesthetic of this film and the strong emotion it elicits-all clearly intended-is more than enough for me to run with. I would\'ve definitely been annoyed if it had been too definitive. This is an anti-war, anti-exceptionalism film about the nature of telling the truth about war. It\'s a masterpiece, it just is.'),(114,6,'9/10','The trailer doesn\'t do this film justice...','jeremy-clay59','10 April 2024','I was genuinely incredibly impressed by this movie. After watching the trailer, I was expecting an Expendables type of film. The reality is that this movie is brilliant. A dark twist and a brief insight into photo journalism and the horrors of war. A lot of time and effort has clearly gone into the production of this film. The way the actors move and react to situations added to the realism and added to the enjoyment of the viewer. Kirstin Dunst wasn\'t my first choice but her performance was spot on. I would recommend watching this film in IMax at the cinema. A lot of the drama would not necessarily be transferred to the small screen. Highly recommend.\n382 out of 707 found this helpful. Was this review helpful?

The characters are going on a mission to reach the White House. And along the way they wind up in several violent misadventures.\n\nBut Apocalypse Now fleshed out the target - Colonel Kurtz. In this story, we have no idea who the President is psychologically and why others want to kill him. So the underlying motivation driving the protagonist is completely lacking.\n\nMoreover, during the course of what is supposedly a war, some of the characters engage in teenage antics that undermine the seriousness of their plight.\n\nAs many other commentators have stated - this movie is disjointed.

But I was completely wrong.\n\nThis is a taste of war experience that shows you the cruelty of real war. It\'s so direct. It doesn\'t confuse you with big talks about politics about powers and conflicts. Instead, it puts you in a position that is vulnerable and also in the very front line of war, it\'s all about experience rather than telling you a intriguing story.\n198 out of 375 found this helpful.

It appears that there is a civil war amongst these United States. California and Texas have seceded from the Union and Florida seems to be having a wobble too. The President (Nick Offerman) makes a speech assuring the rest of his country that they\'ve nothing to worry about, but hardened photo-journalist \"Lee\" (Kirsten Dunst) and her cohort \"Joel\" (Wagner Moura) reckon that the conflict is quite likely to come to an altogether different conclusion. They bravely decide to travel the 800-odd miles to Washington DC to try and interview him. Their out-of-shape veteran associate \"Sammy\" (Stephen McKinley Henderson) thinks they are mad, but also wants in on the trip. Meantime, the enthusiastic young photographer \"Jessie\" (Cailee Spaeny) has managed to hook up with the team and so, rather implausibly, they agree to take her on this perilous journey. It\'s that implausibility that carries the whole thing as the completely preposterous scenario unfolds before us. No effort is made to fill us in on the cause of this warfare. Did the President seize power? Was he elected from a party these states didn\'t vote for? Are they just brutal and well armed revolutionaries? Then we have the ridiculous dialogue - usually from Henderson with his \"always take fuel when you can\" or \"this way only leads to death\" type profundities as the group travel through a remarkably stable, well fuelled and provisioned, nation where there\'s hardly the merest hint of mass migrations, fear or terror. Indeed, their blue \"Press\" helmets and a little bit of kevlar seem to render them immune to the deadly drama that they are supposed to be experiencing. Jesse Plemons makes a brief appearance - that actually leads to the only vaguely exciting part of this chronology, but otherwise it\'s all a bit on a non-event. Dunst starts off as a strong and characterful woman but that dwindles away and, well, I was just a bit bored as the denouement hoved into view with all the predicability of the sun coming up. It\'s bitty, episodic, unrealistic and populated with characters in whom I simply could not believe. Sure, maybe it\'s supposed to be outlandishly apocalyptic, but it reminded me for the most part of an episode of \"Falling Skies\" - only without the aliens. Perhaps it might resonate better with an American audience?

The portrayed factions on purpose don\'t map to any of the current sides. The idea (or claim of intent) is to make the viewer not be able to identify with either side.\n\nThe sides are portrayed as ridiculous and without any good reason. In real life, there have to be strong reasons to go to fight. Even if they are lies or exaggerations. People fight to defend their own ethnicity/nationality/tribe, or to uphold or impose their religion/ideology, or to avenge lost ones. It has to be something very strong to overcome your survival instinct and risk losing your life.\n\nIn the movie, journalists are portrayed as the good people who can\'t understand why the rest are fighting at all. This is the biggest lie of the movie. MEDIA is usually the main way people are stirred into war and conflicts. They define the ENEMY, they vilify it, and convince viewers the other side are non-humans (necessary to convince people to kill others). Any journalist who doesn\'t align with the MEDIA on either side is banished/cancelled. See how it\'s playing in both \"left\" and \"right\" media nowadays. Same happened in both world wars before.\n\nSo this movie pretends to be impartial but it\'s a LIE. It wants to DEMORALIZE people to NEVER REBEL against tyranny.\n\nLike the ones fueling riots and later, once things get out of hand, cry \"why can\'t we get along?\". Media is evil.\n\nHistory teaches if there\'s unjust power grab to destroy a republic people should rebel or suffer the consequences for a very long time.

As a big fan of the Game of Thrones franchise, it\'s been a long time since iv\'e encountered this level of world-building and epicness. The plot and story development are carried out in an awe-inspiring manner throughout the movie, progressing at a precise pace toward a spectacular climax that is executed perfectly.\n\nDenis Villeneuve continues to prove himself as one of the most promising filmmakers of our time, and if it was up to me I would keep him in these high-budget epic tales such as these since there are very few directors working today that can tackle this genre as good as he does. The film received praise from many great filmmakers, the most notable being Christopher Nolan (The Dark Knight Trilogy, Oppenheimer), who very accurately compared Villeneuve\'s achievement in this film to the \"Empire Strikes Back\" of the modern era.\n\nWould highly recommend to re-watch the first movie in order to appreciate the subtleties and foreshadowing better, though it\'s not completely necessary since the movie is pretty self-contained. More specifically, one of the most prominent and impressive strengths of the movie is how it stands on its own without relying too heavily on the first part. Of course, for those who really want to enjoy the story, there\'s no real point in watching the second part without having seen the first one. However, even those who watched it a few years ago and don\'t remember every little plot detail will be able to catch up very quickly while watching the Pt. 2 and will understand all the important details-even the smaller ones. Non-ideally, even someone who hasn\'t watched the first movie at all will greatly enjoy this one, as it is very self-contained despite relying heavily on the first movie-an impressive and highly commendable screenplay effort by the writers.\n\nTimothée Chalamet delivers a very impressive and charismatic performance, to the point where it seems like this is the role he was born to play. Zendaya also gives a very good performance, with significantly more screen time than in the first movie. Austin Butler manages to be terrifying in the role of the villain, Rebecca Ferguson shines in one of the best performances of the year, and Javier Bardem surprises in a role that sometimes provides the comic relief of the movie. In addition to them, the film is filled with top-tier actors and actresses who all perform their roles amazingly.\n\nHans Zimmer\'s score is masterful just as you\'d expect, and one step up from the Oscar winning and Grammy nominated score of Pt. 1. Technical aspects such as VFX, Production Design, Sound, Editing, etc. Are all top notch and awards-worthy. The action sequences are absolutely mind blowing and sent chills down my spine. Denis direction is impeccable, and the story is absolutely fascinating- continuing to develop characters from Pt. 1 even deeper and introduce new incredible and intriguing characters.\n\nIn my personal opinion, the movie is better than the first part in pretty much every aspect. While the first part was excellent, it mainly served as a setup and positioning of the pieces for the sequel. In \"Part 2,\" the story reaches its climax, with one of the strongest climaxes seen on the big screen in recent decades, befitting the complex work Frank Herbert wrote many years ago.\n\nI believe (and surely hope) this movie will be a major player in the next Award Season. Below-the-line wins are pretty much guaranteed as of now, but I hope it will get some love in above-the-line categories such as Direction and even Best Picture, perhaps to break stigmas presented against the Fantasy/Sci-Fi genre in recent years at the Academy. As a big fan of the genre, unless a better competitor will be released later this eligibility period, maybe it\'s time for a movie like this to triumph once again.\n\nWhile the movie serves as a great wrap-up to the story introduced in Pt. 1, in my opinion it could serve as an even better set-up to a possible masterpiece in \"Dune: Messiah\", which I really hope will get green-lit soon.\n\nDon\'t miss the opportunity to catch this movie on IMAX, since I believe it\'s an historic piece of epic-Fantasy/Sci-Fi cinema and a movie that will be remembered as a classic of the genre.\n\nExtremely recommended.'),(122,7,'10/10','WOW!

Also, Hans Zimmer.\n\nFor book readers, I\'d say this one takes more liberties than the first, but they were changes I liked, some for the better even. For the most part, it still hits the main beats from the book with a few things altered. The biggest change being no time jump. Therefore, a certain character doesn\'t fully appear in the movie contrary to the book. Though, they still use the character in a different way that I liked personally.\n\nI know it\'s early in the year, but you can lock some Oscar nominations for this movie: Best Picture, Best Director, Best Adapted Screenplay, Best Editing, Best Cinematography, Best Score, Best Sound, Best Visual Effects, Best Costume, Best Production Design, Best Makeup, and hopefully Rebecca Ferguson this time for Best Supporting Actress.

See for yourself in IMAX. The characters, acting, screenplay, world building, storytelling, score, actions sequences, cinematography, and everything in between make for a cinematic masterpiece. Denis Villeneuve provides a masterclass of filmmaking. The casting continuation was perfect all the way through, with great new add-ons. Timothee Chalamet is believable, raw and real as Paul Atriedes. He was flawless as the lead. Zendaya, Rebecca Ferguson, Javier Bardem, and Josh Brolin are fantastic per usual. Stellan Skarsgard and Dave Bautista continue their evil. Austin Butler steals the show as Feyd-Rautha, and Florence Pugh and Christopher Walken are solid fresh casts.\n\nOverall, Dune: Part Two is an inspiring, visually stunning sci-fi spectacle and an incredible collision of myth, adventure, and destiny on a galactic scale. It\'s a fantastic piece of filmmaking, rarely seen in modern day cinema.\n755 out of 1,111 found this helpful. Was this review helpful?

This makes for an impressive viewing that somehow left me unsatisfied. In De Villeneuve\'s hands the story becomes one of political grandstanding which is but part of what the book is about, both in relation to the hidden ways of the Fremen and the natures and missions of Paul and his mother. For example, in the second part those scenes where Paul Atreides becomes the Kwizatz Haderach are rather weak and not very convincing.\n\nHaving left this essence out of the movies, they become a bit of an emptied out visual experience.

What the film deminded from Kartik and Kabir was a full submission to the craft, as the writing was already good since Petkar\'s life was so inspiring. It usually happens that biopics are safer than fictional stories because they have more realistic sense and more inspirational stuff to offer. Chandu Champion has a champion-like story coming from Muralikant Petkar\'s life, well-handled by Kabir Khan as the storyteller more than a director. His direction can still be at fault for those flaws we see in the film, but as a storyteller, he completely wins.\n\nIn the early 50s, kid Muralikant is taken to a Karad station to see Khashaba Jadhav as he returns from a historic Olympic win. Little Murali, unaware of things, decides to win the Olympic Gold Medal for India and enters Kusti ka akhada. Grown-up Murali (Kartik Aaryan) is teased as \"Chandu Champion\" by locals and is called Kaccha Limbu by his own coach. The perception changes when he beats the opponent Pahalwan in a fight that he was supposed to lose, and then he is ran out of the village, only to find a new direction for his career-the Army. In the Army, Murali is guided by Tiger Ali (Vijay Raaj) in the boxing ring and becomes a sensation at the Olympics. With Gold being so close to him, Murali loses his concentration due to the glamour and glitter around him and loses the final. In 1965\'s war, he is hit by 9 bullets but still survives, only to be left with paralyzed legs. Will he be able to complete his dream of winning gold for India?\n\nWith a considerable amount of fiction and a tell-me-the-same-story kind of presentation, Chandu Champion feels inspiring but repetitive. Vijay Raaj asks Chandu, \"Kabhi suni hai aise stories?\" The entire fault of repetitive cinema lies here in this line. What can we do if the stories are so similar to each other? There might be hundreds of Muralikant Petkars all over the world inspiring millions to \"never give up,\" but in our Maharashtra, we only had one Muralikant Petkar, no? What\'s wrong with telling his story, even if it is similar to many others? This is where every director and screenwriter should work. They can define cinema through new lenses if they can summarize the same story in a different format, in different ratios, and in different ways. The ultimate truth should remain the same.\n\nTalking about flaws, I didn\'t get how a man who has run out of a village in Langot can directly go to an army camp and get admission. Don\'t they ask for any documents? Also, the fact that the glitter disturbs your concentration doesn\'t seem like a big conflict in movies anymore. Even if we think about the 1960s, Milkha Singh went through a similar conflict, so Petkar could have easily avoided that (in real life and reel life, both). Didn\'t his married life deserve that one chunk of screen space? Besides these, I don\'t think there are any major flaws in the movie. It\'s a very good story with a sortable screenplay (which could have been better if we look at how Bhaag Milkha Bhaag and Dangal were handled). Khan\'s storytelling reminds you of his own previous works, if you look carefully. In 83\'s last scene, you see little Sachin Tendulkar on his brother\'s shoulder, and here you see a little girl on her father\'s shoulder waving at Padma Shri winner Petkar. I must say, that flashback trick is older than Petkar\'s real age, so Kabir Khan really needs to improvise himself there.\n\nSpeaking of performances, Chandu Champion entirely belongs to two people: Kartik Aryan and Vijay Raaj. Kartik finally gets to play a challenging role (since it\'s a biopic), which demands physical and characteristic changes throughout the narrative. He does well. But how well? Compared to his own previous works, I can confidently say that Chandu Champion is Kartik Aaryan\'s best performance so far. Yes, in some scenes he brings that old and natural Kartik to spoil the sculptor, but nothing damageable. No more rom-com mediocrity; no more of that chocolate boy tag anymore. He has destroyed that image at once. Vijay Raaj nails the role of Tiger Ali. He is bindass; he is fearless; he is hopeful; and he is funny too. Rajpal Yadav\'s role seems important but it has been showcased with a lot of mediocrity. \"Yayich hai\" and \"Apunich hai\" kinds of language didn\'t seem appropriate for the 1960s (for any character). Yashpal Sharma and Shreyas Talpade are wasted in cringe-worthy roles, while Ganesh Yadav fits well for that small role. I am not sure whether Bhagyashri Borse\'s role was really necessary here. A journalist being so close to contestants during lunch and practice sessions isn\'t plausible at all. Yet, she looked cute, and I personally wouldn\'t mind having such a lovely lady nearby (but it\'s cinema, and I am a critic after all). Talented Sonali Kulkarni gets a small role but does fine, as did the other supporting cast members.\n\nChandu Champion lacks musical finesse. I don\'t know from where that \"Satyanaas\" song appeared. The lyrics and the tone did not suit the situation at all. \"Sarfira\" was okay, but those situations needed a much more inspirational song. The cinematography was good, the sound design was decent, and the production value was high. Kabir Khan has proved that he can\'t really make a \"bad film\" every time (except a few), and the emotional pull he has is much better than that of other directors (except Hirani). Chandu Champion isn\'t his best work, but it\'s not bad or average either. Most of the credit goes to Muralikant Perkar\'s life because the story he has to share with us all is just INCREDIBLE. More than Kartik and Kabir, I really want to meet this man and salute him for whatever he has achieved in his life. Kis mitti ka bana hai ye banda? I really want to find out now.\n\nRATING - 6/10*'),(153,8,'10/10','Movie of the year','prachinew-67234','14 June 2024','What a amazing moving. Acting, direction, story telling, comedy.

This movie is a prime example of everything wrong with Bollywood these days. From the cringe-worthy acting to the laughable special effects, there wasn\'t a single moment where I felt entertained or engaged.\n\nFirstly, the plot was as predictable as sunrise. A cliché story of an underdog trying to become a champion in some obscure sport (which they failed to properly explain). The screenplay felt like it was written by a middle-schooler who just discovered dramatic tropes and wanted to use every single one of them. The dialogues were so insipid that I found myself rolling my eyes more often than I blinked.\n\nLet\'s talk about the performances, if we can call them that. The lead actor, who seemed like he was pulled out of an amateur theatre workshop, displayed a range of expressions varying from confused to constipated. His attempts at emoting were so cringe-inducing that I started rooting for the villain, who was equally unimpressive with his over-the-top evil laughs and cartoonish gestures.\n\nAnd don\'t even get me started on the music. The songs were forgettable at best and ear-gratingly bad at worst. I swear, the background score was so poorly mixed that it felt like a cacophony of random noises rather than music meant to enhance the scenes.\n\nSpecial effects? What special effects? I\'ve seen better CGI in YouTube videos made by teenagers in their basement. The scenes meant to be action-packed were just plain laughable. It was as if the filmmakers decided to cut corners by using outdated software from the early 2000s.\n\nTo sum it up, *Chandu Champion* is a disaster of a film that should serve as a cautionary tale for anyone thinking of entering the film industry without a shred of talent or creativity. Save yourself the agony and skip this one.'),(155,8,'9/10','Must watch movie','murleenair2','15 June 2024','Chandu Champion,\" directed by Kabir Khan, is an absolute gem that stands out as Kartik Aaryan\'s best performance to date. This movie is an enthralling experience from start to finish, showcasing stellar performances and a gripping narrative that keeps the audience hooked.\n\nKartik Aaryan, in the titular role, delivers a performance that is both powerful and nuanced. His portrayal of Chandu is compelling, embodying a range of emotions with remarkable depth and authenticity. Kartik\'s dedication to the role is evident, and he truly deserves all the praise for bringing such a complex character to life with such finesse.\n\nSupporting Kartik is the ever-reliable Vijay Raaz, whose performance adds significant weight to the film. His portrayal is solid and impactful, complementing Kartik\'s performance perfectly. The chemistry between the two actors adds another layer of richness to the movie, making it a more engaging watch.\n\nKabir Khan\'s direction is commendable, weaving a narrative that is both emotionally resonant and visually appealing. However, it\'s unfortunate that \"Chandu Champion\" did not receive the marketing push it deserved. Despite this, the movie is a standout piece of cinema, deserving of a wider audience and greater recognition.\n\nIn my opinion, \"Chandu Champion\" is a 10/10 movie. It\'s a cinematic triumph that combines excellent storytelling, brilliant performances, and masterful direction. Kartik Aaryan\'s exceptional performance is the heart of the film, and he undoubtedly deserves every bit of acclaim for his work.\n\nOverall, \"Chandu Champion\" is a must-watch for anyone who appreciates quality cinema.

The film, which chronicles the life of Murlikant Petkar, India\'s first Paralympic gold medalist, captivates with its potent blend of drama, inspiration, and action.\n\nFrom the outset, the film sets a gripping tone. We first meet Petkar as he awakens from a two-year coma, a consequence of his injuries sustained during military service. This dramatic re-entry into consciousness is both haunting and hopeful, immediately drawing the audience into his tumultuous journey. The narrative then skillfully transitions to his childhood, where young Murli, fondly nicknamed \"Chandu Champion,\" harbors dreams of greatness.\n\nKartik Aaryan\'s portrayal of Petkar is nothing short of transformative. Known for his roles in lighter, comedic fare, Aaryan demonstrates remarkable range and depth, embodying the physical and emotional struggles of his character with authenticity and intensity. His dedication to the role is evident in his physical transformation and the raw emotion he brings to the screen, capturing Petkar\'s indomitable spirit and unwavering determination.\n\nThe screenplay, co-written by Kabir Khan and Neeraj Udhwani, deftly balances the various phases of Petkar\'s life, ensuring that each moment, whether triumphant or tragic, resonates with the audience. The film\'s pacing allows viewers to fully immerse themselves in Petkar\'s journey, from the initial ridicule he faces to his eventual rise as a national hero. This narrative structure not only highlights the personal and societal challenges Petkar overcomes but also serves as a broader commentary on the resilience of the human spirit.\n\nOne of the film\'s strengths lies in its depiction of the socio-political environment of the time. The challenges faced by disabled athletes in India, particularly during Petkar\'s era, are poignantly portrayed, adding depth to the narrative. The film doesn\'t shy away from depicting the harsh realities of the prejudice and lack of support that Petkar faced, making his eventual triumph all the more inspiring.\n\nKabir Khan\'s direction is meticulous, with each scene crafted to enhance the emotional and visual impact of the story. The action sequences, particularly those depicting Petkar\'s sporting events, are exhilarating and shot with a dynamic intensity that keeps the audience on the edge of their seats. Cinematographer Aseem Mishra\'s use of close-ups and wide shots creates a visual narrative that complements the film\'s emotional arc, while Pritam\'s musical score underscores the film\'s dramatic and uplifting moments perfectly.\n\nThe supporting cast, including notable performances by actors like Pankaj Tripathi and Ananya Panday, adds further depth to the film. Tripathi, in particular, shines in his role as Petkar\'s mentor, providing a steady, grounding presence that contrasts with Petkar\'s fiery determination. Panday\'s role, though smaller, is impactful, highlighting the importance of familial and emotional support in Petkar\'s journey.\n\n\"Chandu Champion\" is not just a sports biopic; it\'s a heartfelt tribute to a man who defied the odds and a celebration of perseverance and the relentless pursuit of dreams. The film\'s ability to inspire and evoke a range of emotions is a testament to the collaborative effort of its cast and crew, led by Kabir Khan\'s visionary direction and Kartik Aaryan\'s compelling performance.\n\nIn conclusion, \"Chandu Champion\" stands out as a powerful, inspirational film that will leave a lasting impression on its audience. It\'s a must-watch for those who appreciate stories of grit, determination, and the human capacity to overcome adversity. This film is a testament to the extraordinary achievements possible through unwavering resolve and the courage to dream big.'),(157,8,'9/10','CHANDU NAHI CHAMPION HOON MAIN!','dnathamit','15 June 2024','Finally Kartik Aaryan as an actor has come of age.

The previous trilogy is excellent, and I\'d even say it\'s one of the best genre trilogies ever made (LOTR is #1, of course). Dawn is especially a masterpiece of intelligent sci-fi adventure spectacle, a movie that is both exciting and intelligent. The entire trilogy is emotionally engaging and Caesar is an incredible lead.\n\nUnfortunately, this film doesn\'t have any characters as good as Caesar. In fact, it feels like a lesser retread of the same ideas and themes of the previous trilogy. There\'s nothing really new here. You\'ve already seen a better version of this movie before.\n\nWith that said, let me get the good out of the way first. The cinematography is excellent. The visual effects are still incredible, both as a technical and artistic achievement. The first 45 minutes of the film are really solid. There\'s a lot of good visual storytelling in the opening act.\n\nHowever, once we meet the main antagonist, things kinda fall apart. The pacing is off. Some scenes drag, while major character moments feel rushed. There\'s a friction between two major characters that doesn\'t feel earned, especially since the characters kinda come to an understanding, and then a few scenes later they are butting heads. What could and should have been an interesting dynamic feels incomplete, like entire scenes were cut out.\n\nThe main antagonist could have been really cool. The idea of a cult-like warlord obsessed with human history, there\'s so much they could have done with that idea. But he simply doesn\'t have enough scenes to really make him anything more than Koba Part II. And Koba had better motivations and more complexity. None of the characters here are as well written as the previous trilogy and the last 10 minutes feel more like a TV finale than a movie.\n\nOh, and the music score is pretty generic and forgettable. Really disappointing, because I love the music from the other movies. Caesar\'s theme is so good. Nothing here comes close.\n\nAnyway... Kingdom is far from terrible, but to quote another major franchise with a movie coming out May 2024: \"Mediocre!\"'),(160,9,'6/10','Basic hero\'s journey in a bland entry to a great franchise.','bsabillon','11 May 2024','I\'m bummed I didn\'t love this. The visuals are as good as ever, both from cinematography to cgi it just looks fantastic. Unfortunately it falls flat mostly everywhere else. A classic hero\'s journey through the remnants of this universe\'s apocalyptic landscape is a great idea, but the journey itself is just devoid of sauce. It\'s bland, and often just feels like we\'re watching scenes checking off boxes from an adventure story. Like a movie coming out of an assembly line. Character motivations are unclear, the mc\'s emotional arc is unclear, and overall every idea just doesn\'t feel fleshed out, even when they almost have a good one. How Caesar\'s legacy is handled in this movie is almost interesting, but again it is not fleshed out. I will say the movie starts strong, I didn\'t really start turning on it til I realized how bored I was about halfway through. And that\'s before the third act really just frustrated me. Almost feels like we\'re seeing the first draft of a potentially great movie. Still excited to see where the franchise goes, but this new set of movies is off to a rough start for me.\n96 out of 123 found this helpful. Was this review helpful?

There are reognisable influences from the 1970s TV show and even some of the Apes comic book stories of that era. But, it is also unmistakably a post-Lord of the Rings epic, the influence showing up in how various action and travel sequences have been shot.\n\nWhile there is not nearly so much sly humour as the originals, the socio-historic themes are more nuanced, closer to the surface and harder to miss. Questions of defining civilisation in terms of laws are answered in a way that will ultimately resonate with modern audiences; a layered and varied spectrum of responses to enslavement is shown; and as expected, anti-monarchist revolutions will always play well in the USA.\n\nNon-Americans may roll their eyes a little at the very earnest equating of eagles with capital-L Liberty (one can\'t imagine Charlton Heston\'s sardonic and cynical George Taylor from the 1968 movie being very impressed), but on the plus side, Peter Macon\'s wonderful Raka just about matches the delightful charm of Kim Hunter\'s Zira and Roddy McDowell\'s Cornelius from the originals. Owen Teague also does a good job as Noa.\n\nThe various fight scenes are competent without being overly thrilling (the most exciting action is a cornfield chase vaguely inspired by the original 1968 film), but the deeper probing into the various sub-texts and a fine selection of minor characters keeps the interest levels up. One could pick nits about some of the physics shown in the last twenty minutes, but it\'s hardly the first Hollywood film to sacrifice strict logic for spectacle and it surely won\'t be the last.\n\nOverall, this does a good job of working on several levels and should appeal to a good range of audiences.'),(165,9,'6/10','Shorter would have made a big difference','moviemik-3','12 May 2024','I don\'t know if it\'s just me because in the past 52 hours I have watched all of the Planet of the Apes movies (excluding Tim Burton\'s horrible 2001 version) but it seemed to me that this movie was just OK.\n\nTaking place \"many, many generations\" after Caesar dies, an ape named Noa and his two friends are going through a rite of passage that has to deal with collecting hawks\' eggs when an intruder comes into camp breaking the egg he has collected and was holding for the ceremony the next day. Therefore, he needs to go and collect another egg before said ceremony. While he is out, he runs into a band of apes hurting other apes and they track him back to his village, which they decimate and bring Noa\'s clan into servitude. Noa escapes and seeks out his family and comes across an orangutan named Raka, and they both encounter a human woman who, it turns out, can talk. They are captured and brought to the palace of Proximus Caesar, an evil gorilla who desires to have all apes under his kingdom.\n\nWhile there are many, many nods to the original 1968 film (including musical cues) and the movie had very stunning visual effects, the story itself was kind of lethargic when it wasn\'t in set piece mode.\n\nThe acting - with a couple of exceptions - was just okay and this is an indication that future movies need a protagonist that meets the stature of Andy Serkis and Roddy McDowell. Owen Teague as Noa, is barely adequate and the same can be said for Freya Allen as Mae, the talking human. She obviously has ulterior motives, but her performance doesn\'t. The only three actors in the film that are worth mentioning are Peter Macon as Raka, the orangutan, whose motion capture seems to show his jovial good nature and charm, William H. Macy (yeah! That guy!!!) as a human who educates Proximus Caesar on human history and literature and who radiates the word \"collaborator\" and finally the great character actor Kevin Durand, as big bad Proximus himself. Durand, as he always does, radiates menace.\n\nThere\'s no reason that this story could not have been accomplished in less than 145 minutes and it just seems that nowadays the name of the game is to make movies longer for the sake of making movies longer. This movie really dragged, not because of any poor story choices (because the story itself was decent), but because of poor choices in the editing room.\n\nI see where this movie trilogy is going and it\'s fine but is the next motion picture going to be two hours and 45 minutes long and the final movie in this trilogy going to be three hours long? These are Planet of the Apes movies - we\'re not the defining Pi. The notion that somehow longer is better is absolutely ridiculous.\n\nThis is the worst of the reboot films since 2011\n\nYeah, watch it because it\'s not horrible but it could give you a headache (although I may have a headache because I forgot my eyeglasses when I went to the movie theater but, thankfully, I sat in the fourth row and my eyesight isn\'t that messed up that I couldn\'t see)\n\nIf you\'re into monkeys, WATCH IT - Otherwise, Skip it\n\n3/5.'),(166,9,'8/10','A great start to a new trilogy','Isak777','8 May 2024','A great follow up to the last trilogy.

I really liked how the franchise once again showcases the humanity of the apes, like the touching funeral scene. It had breathtaking scenery throughout, especially the transformation of metropolitan cities into forests. I found it interesting how they introduced pets, a bird is an ape\'s best friend, essentially. I liked that we exploring their customs in the first act of the movie.\n\nWhile the film\'s length and the extensive world-building sometimes made it feel a bit slow, every scene served a purpose in the end, especially considering this\'s setting the stage for a new era in the Planet of the Apes movies. We get to see how the environment, the apes and the humans have evolved. I liked how the movie paid homage to Caesar without directly continuing his story; his legacy felt respectfully acknowledged. He had a good run and his story was complete.\n\nThe premise of the movie, particularly the portrayal of the antagonists, reminded me of religious wars, where the apes resemble Christian crusaders using a historic figure\'s image to justify war and violence, a theme with deep implications. The movie addresses that but not in a way that will make you leave the theatre pondering. How teachings can be misconstrued.\n\nThis installment\'s message felt more overt compared to the trilogy, almost as if the apes were portrayed as essentially human. The trilogy was always telling a human story through apes, it was always obvious but now the fourth installment is quite on the nose.\n\nGood time is spent with the characters, so when moments of sadness or goodbyes arise, we feel it too. It\'s slow paced but I was heavily invested. The scene where she calls out to Noah was amazing. Hearing an \'echo\' speaking, was almost as shocking when Caesar screamed \"go!\" for the first time. Also was she essentially looking for an English textbook? Lol.\n\nWhile Noah is the lead character, there were instances where Mae took the forefront, causing some confusion about the movie\'s primary focus. She didn\'t feel explored or interesting enough but I loved Freya Allan\'s performance.\n\nIt\'s a drama. It\'s not what I was expecting, I thought it\'d me more action packed, but it\'s still good. It was different to my expectations the way \"War for the Planet of the apes\" also wasn\'t a full blown war as well. I also think this is the first movie since the trilogy started where earth was now actually a planet of apes. Humans clearly have been dominated.\n\nFollowing up on Caesar was always gonna be difficult, I think he was a beloved character and we got to see his whole journey. The new lead character Noah is alright, however, I didn\'t find myself super captivated by him. We got to see Caesar\'s full character arc, birth to death; while Noah is already a little older, coming-of-age age. His story is still interesting though.\n\nThe conflict of ideas between Noah and Mae could have been more intense. There were times when I thought \"ouu this is about to be a big fight/argument\" and it\'s just meh. It wasn\'t as thought provoking as I would\'ve liked. I liked Proximus Caesar though, I thought he made quite the enticing antagonist. Second most interesting character after Raka*.\n\nThe ending hints at the possibility of another trilogy, laying a solid foundation for future installments. Overall, I liked it more than \"Rise of the Planet of the Apes\" but not as much as the sequels. \"Dawn of the planet of the apes\" is still my favorite. It\'s not as epic as I thought it\'d be; I think it\'s more enjoyable if you\'re already into the franchise. It doesn\'t do anything terribly, I just didn\'t walk out of the theatre thinking \"wow!\" People were applauding a lot throughout the movie actually. There was a guy who sat close to me and blacked out before the movie started, snoring the entire time. Thought about not waking him up after the movie finished because everyone literally just walked by him. This dude bought imax tickets, large bucket of popcorn, large soda and some more snacks, all that just to sleep before the movie started. Anyway, I still enjoyed the whole thing, and very much looking forward to whatever\'s next.\n\nAlso just found out it\'s directed by they who did maze runner movies and they actually both have such similar aura to them.'),(168,9,'8/10','Rich Emotion, GREAT CGI','bankofmarquis','11 May 2024','If someone would have said that 2 of the more emotionally rich movie going experiences of the past 6 months (or so) would have been a Godzilla movie and a Planet of the Apes film, I never would have believed you.\n\nBut such is the case with last fall\'s GODZILLA MINUS ONE and the new KINGDOM OF THE PLANET OF THE APES. 2 CGI-rich action/fantasy epics that focus more on the emotional heft of the characters rather than inundate the audience with over-the-top, flashy CGI.\n\nAre you paying attention KONG x GODZILLA: THE NEW EMPIRE?\n\nSet \"many generations\" after the events of the previous 3 Planet of the Apes films, KINGDOM OF THE PLANET OF THE APES takes place in a world where the Apes (not man) rule the planet.

Their clan of chimpanzees is overpowered - and thrown into slavery - by a clan of Gorillas led by Proxima Caeser (Kevin Durand - Little John in the Russel Crowe ROBIN HOOD film of 2010) - also ably rendered in motion capture. This sets Noa on a journey to rescue his clan aided by an Orangutan, Rata (Peter Macon - Bortus in the t.v.

The motion-capture of the actors is superb - this technology has come a long way since Tom Hanks in THE POLAR EXPRESS and one forgets that one is looking at a rendering and not a real, flesh and blood actor - even if that actor is an ape.\n\nDirector Wes Ball (the MAZE RUNNER films) does a very strong job of keeping the plot moving and the characters grounded while also dazzling with marvelous special effects and battle scenes that are well choreographed (you know where all the major players are and what their motivations are during the action).

While I liked the trilogy, I didn\'t think they had been quite the blockbusters to spawn another trilogy, and they had a sombre tone. Nevertheless intrigued, I went for the early screening not having even watched a trailer or read anything about it.\n\nFirst off, watch it on whichever premium format you can. The CGI is really well done from apes emoting to the dramatic terrains.\n\nI liked that the hero was a little diffident at first but grew with the story. Sure we\'ve seen it a thousand times, but it was still an identifiable journey.\n\nThe ideology splits were shown well, the action sequences were effective and the shades of characters kept me interested. Sure it left a few questions hanging, but I guess those are for the sequel(s).\n\nPacing did feel slow at times but I like that personally better than nonstop effects and explosions. Mae was the more intriguing character, with Noa\'s arc (see what I did there) being a more predictable one. If you let yourself go on the journey, I think you\'ll enjoy it. No huge surprises in the story though - you\'ll know if you\'re gonna like it or not pretty much in the first act.

However this one is really disappointing! While the cinematography and AI is absolutely phenomenal, the lead characters have far too human traits! And the human lead character, very disappointing & unbelievable, the casting of Freya Allan is really hammy, they obviously needed a Gen Z in the film. Too many holes in the plot, they filled up the film with stuff & missed opportunities to explore some scenarios in more depth. There was a great opportunity to give a nod to the original, when they were walking along the beach which they missed, (guess what I\'m thinking)?.

Aren\'t they the plots of Dawn of the Planet of the Apes & War of the Planet of the Apes put together? And somehow most of the film consists of the most uninteresting world exploration and character development. It was almost like they intentionally set the excitement bar low so the next film(s) can easily appear more exciting. If you\'re expecting an action packed adventure, maybe save your money instead. I wasn\'t necessarily expecting an action packed adventure, but I expected a bit more than one 5 min action scene. I would also expect to care about the story.\n\nWar for the Planet of the Apes is on my 10/10 list, and for it to be followed up by THIS is insulting.

The most appealing post-apocalyptic world I visited as far as I can remember!','ridleyrules','8 May 2024','100% spoiler-free review\n\nI just watched this on 8 May 2024 in the ScreenX format. Does the format add something? Yes! Is it worth driving an extra hour for? Yes! Will the movie still be enjoyable in the more regular formats? Absolutely, the movie is worth it either way!\n\nAs preparation for this movie. I re-watched the Ceasar trilogy Rise (2011, 2D), Dawn (2014, wonderfully, natively shot with 3D cameras) and War (2017, 3D added, partly in post) in my 3D-capable home theater. It is a very moving trilogy that I had not viewed in a while, a worthwhile re-watch. Is it necessary to understand this 2024 edition Kingdom? No, not at all. It will add depth to the experience, but the new story can be understood and followed without having seen the first trilogy.\n\nThere is no 3D release of this new feature, Kingdom, unfortunately. No 3D version anywhere in the world, from what I found. In my country (Netherlands) it is playing in the premium formats Imax, 4DX (which is still 2D in this case), Dolby Cinema and ScreenX. I do my research and usually I tend to go for ScreenX if I have similar options to choose from. Why? ScreenX adds peripheral imagery that is specially shot for a selection of scenes, usually the scenes where the viewer can be immersed in the action or the environments. There are 5 or 6 long sections where the side screens are turned on. It is not an add-on effect created in post, there is actual additional, original footage to the left and right that you don\'t get to see in any of the other formats. There is also no way to see it at home yet, as far as I know, although it could be released for VR glasses, I imagine, similar to how Disney+ recently released Disney and Pixar 3D movies for the Apple Vision Pro.\n\nI am someone who avoids watching previews and trailers. I want to go into a movie with zero information about what I am going to see. I hate those spoiler-ridden trailers that give half the plot points away. So I am not going to say anything about the story.\n\nAll I want to say is that this post-apocalyptic world is the most appealing that I can remember experiencing. It brings a totally different feeling than e.g. The Mad Max movies, Fallout, The Road or Akira. Even though there is something imminently sad about this possible future, it has an appeal that is comparable more to James Cameron\'s Avatar movies on Pandora. Where the Ceasar trilogy showed a not so distant future of earth, here we get to look around in an intriguing green world full of surprises.\n\nI am not very familiar with director Wes Ball\'s previous films, but he does a wonderful job following into Matt Reeves\'s (Dawn and War) footsteps. Yes, this is science fiction. Yes, it is a marvel of technology that we can be immersed into this world, but in the end it is a movie where you are swept away by engaging performances and story lines, not by special effects.

The Heisei era is my overall favorite, and I thought Shin Godzilla was weird in all the right ways. It was one of my favorite movies from that year.\n\nThis one might be even better. You actually care about the characters. It deals with some very serious topics, such as survivors guilt and the aftermath of war violence on civilians and conflicting emotions around national pride and feeling betrayed by your government. Yet the film is also exciting and optimistic and has some of the best Godzilla sequences ever put to screen. My favorite depiction of Godzilla is as a force of nature, representing the power of the atomic bomb or the fury of war itself. That\'s the Godzilla you get here. I think this film can very favorably be compared to American classics like Jaws and Jurassic Park, too.\n\nI don\'t want to say too much, it\'s best to just experience the movie for yourself. The only part that felt a little false to me was the very end, but I understand why the director wanted to do it that way. The special effects look great for the most part, but there are a couple of shots here and there that aren\'t perfect when compared to some Hollywood movies. However, it hardly matters. This is an incredible film.\n\n9/10 easily, probably closer to 9.5\n\nMy current Godzilla rankings:\n\n1) Gojira (1954) 2) Godzilla Minus One (2023) 3) Godzilla vs. Destoroyah (1995) 4) Shin Godzilla (2016) 5) Return of Godzilla (1984)\n\nSpecial mentions to GMK, Godzilla vs. Biollante, Godzilla vs. Mechagodzilla (1974) and Mothra vs. Godzilla (1964)'),(181,11,'9/10','This is one of the best iterations of Godzilla I have ever seen, and I have seen them all','sheridan-turner','30 November 2023','I just saw the advanced screening of Godzilla minus one and I have to say I was very pleased with the final product.

Once you see this movie at some point you will understand why.\n\nWhat I would really like to see since it is clear that there have been multiple Godzilla\'s at some point in time is some type of legitimate crossover between toho and the American studios who are producing Godzilla monster verse in America. Last thing I or any fans want to see is a competition on who could spit out different and unique Godzilla\'s in two different countries.\n\nSince this is a Toho and Japanese produced movie, it would have been nice to have some of the theater edition Godzilla toys for sale like they do in Japan on every release.'),(182,11,'10/10','This is what a Godzilla is supposed to be','dormantgene','30 November 2023','From the opening to the ending, I was enthralled by the whole movie.

I do feel like among certain fan circles the movie is slightly \'overhyped\' but that doesn\'t make the movie bad, it is in fact quite good. I think the exploration of the main character\'s relationship with kamikaze piloting, and in turn both Japan\'s historical understanding of that phenomenon as well as the West\'s, is actually still more poignant and worth exploring than perhaps we might be inclined to give it credit for. It\'s hard to overstate how culturally significant the kamikaze pilots were during and in the immediate aftermath of World War 2; although we had Oppenheimer to remind us of the cultural impact of the bomb, for soldiers that lived during World War 2, it was the stories of the kamikaze pilots that left a huge impact, even for people not in the Pacific theater. Likewise, Japan has long struggled to articulate its historical relationship to kamikaze pilots, with the memorial there being a kind of hot-button issue for multiple decades now. This film perhaps doesn\'t offer a searing insight, but rather a kind of wishful alternate path to how Japan and the west feels about kamikaze pilots. I think what\'s particularly remarkable about this film, frankly, is the way it pushes against the grain--a lot of Japanese cinema, especially that designed for view by western audiences, tends toward a construction of victimhood due to the bomb. This film tries to grapple with the echoes of imperial desire both immediately after the war and, perhaps, now.\n\nHonestly, come for the big cool depiction of Godzilla, but leave with a reflection of Japan\'s relationship to World War 2.'),(187,11,'8/10','If you don\'t know what \"Minus One\" refers too','AreSee5454','22 December 2023','Those wondering, according to Yamazaki, \"Minus One\" refers to the level of where Japan had to start when rebuilding Japan after WWII.

Notice that no government really does anything in the movie. The U. S. is sidelined because of concerns over raising tensions with the Soviets; the Japanese government is unable to act. Instead, it\'s the people themselves who have to act and save themselves.\n\nTowards the end, the film veers harder and harder towards melodrama, which detracted from the nice balance of seriousness and humor that had been present throughout the first several acts.

It gave me everything i wanted for the first time ever I was actually invested in the human characters and their story normally you are just waiting for Godzilla to show up but not here Godzilla shows up alot and when he does he is BRUTAL. This Godzilla makes things personal by actively attacking the humans. The movie had great pacing where it doesn\'t feel like it\'s going on for too long and it was nice to have a darker story set after WW2. It really goes back to the franchise\'s roots. There\'s so much to say but it would give a lot away JUST SEE THE MOVIE ON THE BIGGEST SCREEN POSSIBLE 9/10.\n191 out of 232 found this helpful. Was this review helpful?

The Human characters were very well written, the acting was outstanding, the emotions were strong with loss, pride and hope. The main cast were perfect together as a group, even the minor characters were amazing. The music, Oh My God the Music was conducted to fit every scene it was in and the OG theme was incredible to hear in a Dolby theater for the first time. Akira Ifukube would be proud, May he Rest In Peace. Lastly it was very educating in a way to see what Japan was like immediately after the War following the Atomic Bombs. The hardships they went through just to rebuild was very emotional to watch, but the way they climbed out of that pit of hopelessness would inspire any viewer to the franchise both Long Time along with Newer Fans\n\nNow to the matter at Hand, the Star Himself, GODZILLA.\n\nThe King of the Monsters is more terrifying in this movie than any other in the 69 year history of the Longest running franchise in the World! Every time he appears on screen he strikes fear into your very soul and leaves you in Awe at the same time. His destruction was unrelenting, the action out of this world, his Power Godly, his portrayal Very Real. At times you almost feel sorry for him because what\'s happened to him wasn\'t his fault. I haven\'t seen a monster movie this well done since Peter Jackson\'s King Kong (2005) and Cloverfield (2008).\n\nMy solid review of this movie is a 10/10, and I recommend save notifications of any kind for when this movie hits the Home Media market because I sure will.\n\nHonestly I don\'t think I\'ve ever watched a movie this perfect before\n\nLast note, The Whole Theater shook everytime Godzilla took a Step and my very bones were vibrating from his Roar #godzilla #godzilla1954 #godzillaminusone #monster #japan.'),(196,11,'7/10','Not like any other Godzilla movie','anshumankrsingh','1 June 2024','I\'m glad Japanese filmmakers are not consumed by the jingoism and blind hatred towards the U.

It\'s no doubt thanks to all new creators\' mindset to try to outperform the previous works, based on and standing at the established brand \"Godzilla\". All the successors can benchmark the prior ones and analyze their successful points and failures. Yamazaki learned a lot from Anno\'s work and made some improvements and corrections particularly on the point that it couldn\'t catch on overseas. One of them is the music. He succeeded in taking on Naoki Sato, who is the graduate of Tokyo university of the arts, paying respect to the alumni and predecessor Ifukube and understanding his music deeply. In this film, vision and music are fantastically synchronized. And of course, the main character is Godzilla, but Yamazaki has done well in letting him act simply as a fearful object. Therefore, we can empathize fully with characters competing with Godzilla. Yamazaki who has suffered a streak of bummers in making films looks to be recovering his confidence, and is expected to deliver another sequel of Godzilla film, in which we can see a \"real\" duel with monsters like Ghidra or Mothra.'),(198,11,'BallerinaWick','Now that\'s how you make a Godzilla movie','5 May 2024','Was this review helpful?

With some going as far as to call it their favourite movie of the year. I\'m not sure i\'d go that far but its a decent watch, and definitely better than the Godzilla remakes/redos the US has been putting out.\n\nThe good thing is that the movie actually has a story, and isn\'t just giant monster effects. The humans are at the heart of the whole thing, and it all feels different being set in the 1940\'s and feeding off World war 2. While respecting the original Japanese movies with its stylish music. The effects are also great with some of the water stuff looking particularly cool.\n\nBut it could of done with a bit more action and Godzilla looks a bit wonky at times. There\'s alot of chat in the movie which is mostly good. Until it goes on a bit long after the main attack at the centre of the movie. The ending also felt like a massive copout unfortunately in more ways than one.'),(200,11,'4/10','TV show quality CGI, only 5 or 7 minutes of Godzilla. A HUGE disappointment after reading all of the positive reviews.','c0ntra','17 December 2023','If you love the classic Godzilla movies, go see this movie, you\'ll think it\'s awesome. Everyone else who\'s over 18 is going to feel like they\'ve wasted their time and money on something which is no better than a made for TV movie.\n\nThe CGI, albeit detailed, is laughably bad and obviously CGI each time you see it; The lighting/shading is all wrong. It would look great in a modern Anime, or something where everything is in CGI, but not this. The only good thing about this movie was the acting, and only if you are used to the acting in older Japanese flicks, where it\'s a bit over the top and sappy at times, but it felt like everyone was acting in-period together, and really helped set the tone for the movie\'s classic look and feel.\n\nOther than this, everything about it was rubbish. The storyboard and cuts were nonsensical and felt disjointed and abrupt. There was no seamless flow between scenes or parts, which made it feel amateurish like a pilot of a new TV series sometimes is. Don\'t even get me started on the cartoonish looking Godzilla, with it\'s undersized head, googly eyes, and baby t-rex like arms. As if the CGI wasn\'t bad enough, the director decided to make Godzilla look like a joke on purpose as homage to the original, but it just made me unnerved to watch. It\'s not scary anymore because of this; the fear wasn\'t there for me because of the poorly executed cgi, lack of build-up to destruction scenes, or enough shots of Godzilla doing anything.\n\nI can\'t believe the same director thinks he\'s good enough to shoot a Star Wars movie because of the feedback he\'s getting from this movie. Please don\'t.\n\nAlso, save yourself some time and grief and don\'t go see this movie. I was seriously embarrassed to bring my partner to this after reading all the hype. You can\'t trust ratings for movies anymore until they\'ve been out for long enough, and definitely not ones with a cult following like this. This movie is a sold 4/10, seriously. It\'s just not very good.'),(201,12,'8/10','Fun Movie, fun cast!','koltonbrett','15 April 2024','As a fan of both Henry Cavill and Guy Ritchie, I was thrilled to find an early access showing of this movie at a nearby theater.\n\nUngentlemanly Warfare looked to be a good time, and indeed it is! It\'s a neat story and they made the telling of it fun. Thankfully it isn\'t goofy. It\'s not nonstop jokes, but it has a good sense of humor and I heard a good bit of chuckling in the theater throughout the movie, much of it coming from myself.\n\nYou can tell Cavill had fun with this role. He shows off some range as his character is very different from the brooding muscle man that many people associate him with. It was delightful watching him do comedy. I haven\'t seen much of Alan Ritchson\'s work, but it was easy to see why he has such a growing fanbase. He\'s the muscle in this movie and proves to be a great action star. The whole cast is great and they give us a lot of fun characters.\n\nAction-comedies seem to be Guy Ritchie\'s specialty. He maintains a good balance of action and comedy and works so well with large casts as he lets every character feel like they matter to the story.'),(202,12,'6/10','I didn\'t hate it, but I didn\'t love it either','ghettoplex','23 April 2024','Let me start with the positives.\n\nLike most Guy Ritchie films, the ensemble has great chemistry. Henry Cavill doesn\'t disappoint, he keeps the pace going and interactions between everyone fun to watch. Alan Ritchson does great as a force of nature, dude is built like a tank. Babs Olusanmokun is slick, he has a very smooth demeanor to his performance. Lastly, Eiza Gonzalez is absolutely beautiful, however her performance was hit or miss for me. But she hit more than she missed.\n\nNow, the negatives.\n\nThe movie doesn\'t feel like it was even made by Guy Ritchie.

Not a lot was asked of this talented cast. Also, as often happens with ensembles, we really only get to know our characters on the most superficial level. (Ensembles need franchises to tease out individuals\' personal stories). Hard to be invested in their survival.\n\nAnd finally, what a waste of Henry Cavill. Cavill has a great face for this sort of role. Smirks, frowns and grins were swallowed up in a curiously overgrown mustache and beard. Why hire That Face and then hide it completely? Similarly, he spends the entire film, bundled up in multiple shabby layers of clothing. We\'re they trying to hide his physique so he wouldn\'t look too much like his costar Ritchson? Not a problem as Ritchson has at least 3 inches and 25lbs of muscle on Cavill any day of the week.\n\nThey could have hired any one of a dozen other actors for the role if they didn\'t plan to let us SEE Cavill. And paid a lot less for them.\n\nI came away annoyed by the promise of Cavill unfulfilled and by a storyline that wouldn\'t have made for an interesting episode of The A Team.\n\nBut Alan Ritchson was great. He clearly had way more fun with this character than he gets to have with Reacher.'),(204,12,'7/10','Great Guy Ritchie Insanity','mark-67214-52993','27 April 2024','Guy Ritchie\'s \"Ungentlemanly Warfare\" is based, kinda, on the true exploits of Britain\'s Special Operations Executive (SOE) during World War II. Unsurprisingly, given Ritchie\'s involvement, liberties have been taken with the story.\n\nThe SOE existed to operate behind enemy lines, committing sabotage and various other acts considered ungentlemanly by the upper crust officers who ran the conventional army. In 1942, England was starving and its army could not be resupplied because German U-boats owned the seas. With the blessing of Winston Churchill, the commander of the SOE sent a team to destroy the Duchessa d\'Aosta, a supply ship that supplied all the carbon dioxide filters for the U-boats. These filters permitted these submarines to remain submerged for prolonged periods. By disabling the supply ship, the U-boat fleet would be effectively sidelined. The mission was labelled Operation Postmaster. It took place in January, 1942. This story centers on the real characters - Gus March-Phillips (Henry Cavill), Anders Larssen (Alan Ritchson) and Geoffrey Appleyard (Alex Pettyfer) - who were sent to complete this mission. In this film, some totally fictitious characters and other amalgamations of real-life participants also tagged along.\n\n\"Ungentlemanly Warfare\" contains all the satisfying flourishes of a film by Guy Ritchie (\"Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels,\" \"Sherlock Holmes,\" \"The Gentlemen\"). This film is cool and stylish. It\'s filled with swaggering characters spouting cheeky dialogue. There are flashbacks to keep the moviegoer off-balance. There are first-rate set pieces/action scenes. Oh, and there\'s violence - lots and lots of violence, most of it gratuitous. Did I mention the violence? The entire package is delivered with a manic gleefulness that\'s contagious.\n\nWhile the story is \"based on true events,\" reality is just a jumping off point. This film suggests that a major role of the operation was to persuade an officially neutral US to enter the war and begin helping Britain. Pearl Harbor occurred the month before, so the US was already fully engaged. The film also suggests that by disabling the supply ship, the SOE\'s mission could change the course of the war. While the events depicted in \"Ungentlemanly Warfare\" were not unimportant, a bigger factor was the development of RDX, an explosive powerful enough to sink the U-boats in the open sea.\n\nThe film offers an interesting side note. One of the staffers for the SOE depicted in the film is a young officer named Ian Fleming (Freddie Fox). Yep, that Ian Fleming. His boss was known as M. In his James Bond novels, Fleming incorporates the character of M. Fleming has noted several times that the character of James Bond was based on Gus March-Phillips.\n\nTo summarize, the cast here is charming and appealing, in no small part because they appear to be reveling in their madcap roles. Some of the location shots (much of the movie was filmed in Antalya, Turkey) make the film as worthwhile as a NatGeo documentary. The \"true story\" is a muddled mess. And there\'s the violence, lots and lots of violence. (Historical note: no one was actually killed during Operation Postmaster, although one Nazi soldier fainted at the sight of the intruders.) Guy Ritchie\'s energy and enthusiasm, which permeate this piece, will win over a lot of the folks in the seats.'),(205,12,'6/10','WW2\'s Oceans 11','Ryan331','16 April 2024','The movie is fun for the most part, but not the strongest Ritchie film. The trailer is a great representation of the film - the cheekiness, costumes, violence, and Henry Cavill\'s twirly mustache. If you liked the trailer, you\'ll probably enjoy the film.\n\nI do think the movie could\'ve been a lot more but was bogged down by the \"true story\" aspect. There are a few scenes that felt very Tarantino-esque in its hyper violence or intensity, but likely couldn\'t be taken further because of the limitations of a true story. While not mad at the casting, they could\'ve skipped on giving Alan Ritchson the crappy danish accent. And when Eiza Gonzalez\'s character\'s ethnicity is introduced, you\'ll probably raise an eyebrow considering she\'s a Mexican actress.\n72 out of 117 found this helpful. Was this review helpful?

This Guy Ritchie movie is most definitely highly fictionalized. It\'s 1942. Britain is in its darkest hour. The Blitz is destroying London. U-boats are cutting off the Atlantic supply route. America remains on the sidelines. The Nazis\' main U-boat supply ship is located in a neutral Spanish colonial west African port. British parliament refuses to attack a neutral country. Winston Churchill secretly orders the unauthorized mission led by imprisoned soldier Gus March-Phillips (Henry Cavill) with his motley crew of outsiders.\n\nThis is one of those real fake history movies. It\'s more than the normal fictionalization. It\'s got the wild sardonic Guy Ritchie humor. These characters are rather one dimensional with a few exceptions. It feels more like a comic book movie although that\'s fine since that\'s the intention. A highlight is the insanely gorgeous Eiza González. Alan Ritchson and his giant muscles seem to be popping up everywhere. I like this, but I don\'t love it.\n22 out of 32 found this helpful. Was this review helpful?

Spiritually this film feels like a violent successor to The Man from UNCLE despite it being set decades prior.

I was one of six people in the theatre - clearly, a secret movie experience is a hard sell. However, I was excited at the prospect of watching something without knowing exactly what it would be. And after the trailers concluded, the lights dimmed and the film began to roll - to my delight, the secret movie was \"The Ministry of Ungentlemanly Warfare.\"\n\nAs a Guy Ritchie fan, after having seen the trailer for this movie, I knew I wanted to see it - although, admittedly, I didn\'t think the trailer was especially striking. However, I like Ritchie, and I love Cavill, so I was pleasantly surprised at the reveal of this film being the secret movie. And you know what? This is actually a pretty fun flick.\n\nYes, there is nothing too innovative at play here - this is standard Ritchie fare, except more nuanced and less extreme in its directing and editing choices than, say, Ritchie\'s King Arthur film. \"Ministry\" plays out more like a typical action adventure movie with flares of Ritchie\'s signature style coming out here and there; and this more subdued approach actually works to the movie\'s advantage to highlight some of the more dramatic and intense moments. But if you\'re going to see this film, you\'re most likely going to see it due to the action that the trailer promised you. And how is the action? In a word: Great.\n\nMy only complaint about the violence in this film - not to sound too bloodthirsty - is that it is surprisingly bloodless for an R-rated movie. I was really expecting something akin to Quentin Tarantino, with huge spurts of blood and gory deaths, but Ritchie, once again, takes a more subdued approach, choosing not to showcase a lot of blood or grisly images. That said, the action in this movie is still FANtastic, playing out an intensity that is simply missing from most modern action movies. There are plenty of shootouts - both with guns and with arrows; there are knife fights and axe battles; there are hand to hand combat sequences; basically, all of the WW2 action you can imagine is in this movie, and it\'s filmed wonderfully, without shaky camera or quick cuts. Sure, I would\'ve preferred a bit more blood when Nazi\'s were punched or shot or sliced, but I can\'t knock Ritchie for choosing not to include that for the sole reason that the action is filmed so freaking well. It\'s nice to watch an action movie that has two things: 1) a lot of action and 2) clearly filmed action. Luckily, \"Ministry\" has both of those things, and because of that, will be sure to satisfy even the most jaded action junkie.\n\nIn Ritchie films, both the plot and the actors are always standouts, and it\'s no different here in \"Ministry.\" Cavill and his band of ungentlemanly warriors are all super entertaining to watch, their chemistry leading to many laugh out loud moments. Additionally, the plot - as IMDB puts it, \"a small group of highly skilled soldiers strik(ing) against German forces behind enemy lines during World War II,\" offers a lot more meat to chew on than you might expect. There are a lot of things happening concurrently, which leads to storylines converging in a pretty satisfying way. There are also a few unexpected moments that force the plot to go in directions I didn\'t expect, but certainly enjoyed watching. The plot isn\'t anything phenomenal, but it kept me engaged and was a great vehicle for its characters and action.\n\n\"The Ministry of Ungentlemanly Warfare\" is a good time at the theatre. This doesn\'t necessarily offer something that you haven\'t seen before, but in a genre as tired as WW2 action is, \"Ministry\" shakes things up just enough in terms of its colourful characters and explosive action that you can\'t help but have fun watching this. And if you\'re a fan of Guy Ritchie? Then going to see this is really a no brainer.'),(210,12,'9/10','Fun and true','clayhanika','17 April 2024','Saw this movie last weekend. No complaints here.

We might be living in a very different world if they failed and Churchill was put out and the appeasement faction got their way. Thankfully, we don\'t have to live that alternate history because these guys rocked and did what they had to.

It was not what I had hoped, but more or less what I expected. If you like movies based on Historical events, that seem to also show the connection between new film franchises, and old, this is a pretty good film for that.\n\nYou have Henry Cavill walking through the entire film, with zero sense of urgency. You have the poor man\'s Gal Gadot, who does nothing but act as eye candy and a distraction to both the on screen talent, and the audience. You have Alan Ritchson who more or less steals the entire film as the lunatic killing machine. Honestly everyone does a decent job but frankly you could have cast anyone in this movie and it would have turned out the same.\n\nI like some things I have seen by Guy Ritchie, but this movie is a little less interesting because everything is so bland and safe.

That\'s the thing.

So, in theory, I should have liked this movie. However, I also like the movies not to be just a bunch of worn out tropes and cliches loosely stitched together without any sense, and this movie is exactly that.\n\nThere is very little good about it, but plenty of bad. The script, although based on a true, and supposedly interesting, story, is horrible, making for an uninteresting and completely unbelievable viewing. The protagonists are basically an indestructible bunch of superheroes, that cannot be harmed by any means, and destroy enemies by merely looking at them. They loosely wave their weapons in the general direction of the enemies and the enemies all die, apparently killed by self guided smart bullets.\n\nThe British government and military is supposedly full of traitors, defeatists and collaborationists, except for maybe two guys and the superhero team. Also, we are never given a satisfactory reason why they would be so vehemently opposed to the mission. Maybe because it was so \"ungentlemanly\" and the British are such gentlemen (if being a gentleman means stealing other nations\' lands and resources and killing the native people, while saying \"sir\" and \"good morning\" in a very stuck up way).\n\nThere is zero tension. Fake, \"insurmountable\" obstacles are introduced every couple of minutes, only to be resolved seconds later without any effort. By the time it happens for the second or third time, you don\'t care at all, because you know that it doesn\'t mean anything.\n\nThere is no character development, no originality. Protagonists are the best at everything. The main villain has zero personality, zero originality, zero... anything. He is super evil, the end, and he basically does nothing for the whole movie, except existing in a very evil way.\n\nAlan Ritchson\'s character is supposed to be 22. Ritchson can\'t pass as a twenty-something by any stretch of imagination.\n\nThe obligatory femme fatale is a paper thin stereotype, the best looking, the smartest, the coolest. She is also a crack shot that hits every target with the aiming technique that would not enable her to hit the side of a barn from two steps away. She is also supposed to be British-German-Jewish, but the actress is Mexican and looks it.\n\nThe movie is also filled by meaningless scenes of empty and stupid dialogue that is supposed to sound deep and smart but instead just pads the run time. The action scenes, on the other hand, are too cartoonish to be taken seriously, and not funny enough to be considered comedy.\n\nI kept watching hoping that it would get better, but it stayed flat and boring until the end.'),(213,12,'6/10','It\'s okay but not compelling','drael64','11 May 2024','I\'m not sure how they managed to make a fictional retelling of a real historical military story like this one feel low stakes, but unfortunately that is how the movie feels.

With this nice ensemble and decent budget, great production design, and a director who in theory definitely should have the chops, THE MINISTRY OF UNGENTLEMANLY WARFARE had everything it needed and more.\n\nAnd yet, it misses the mark. Much of it has to do with the direction, I\'m afraid. A lack of spirit and inspiration can be felt throughout the film, sometimes worse than other times, but neither the shots he called nor his direction of the actors are worthy of Ritchie\'s potential. The script could have used a bit more polishing, especially concerning the dialogue, but it\'s really mostly the practical aspects where this falls flat.\n\nIf you\'re a native German speaker, you will also notice how bad the fake Germans actually are. They should have been dubbed, but nobody seemed to care. Even Til Schweiger messed up some lines in German (probably drunk on set, as usual) - nobody cared.\n\nWhat also made the film worse than it could have been is the score. Someone told the composer to go for \"Schifrin meets Morricone\", I guess, and what he delivered was a weak attempt at copying both. No swing, no drama, no feeling whatsoever. Just flat and boring, matching the direction perfectly.\n\nThat being said, you can still kill a bit of time watching this, since Cavill, Ritchson, et al are very likeable and have a lot of charming presence. Locations are nice, the DoP did a great job with the lighting, and Eiza González has a great singing performance (refreshingly with no audible pitch correction, but as a professional singer with an amazing voice she really doesn\'t need any), even though the arrangement and interpretation of the famous \"Mack The Knife\" is quite horrible.\n\nBut if anything, this has made me wish for a more silly WW2 comedy with Cary Elwes in the lead.

In some ways, the movie highlights a fascinating mission from WWII while doing a disservice to the men involved.\n\nThose script issues aside, the movie\'s direction and tone are very fun. There\'s a great musical sequence I very much enjoyed and I did find myself invested in the mission as the third act neared. Don\'t expect to be on the edge of your seat as this is less about suspense and all about style. But it was a fun time at the theater and I think it\'s worth seeing for that alone.\n\nSide note: YMMV but save for a bloody moment or two, it\'s far less graphic than the R rating may lead you to believe.'),(216,12,'6/10','Really wanted to like it','blackhawk5150','22 June 2024','I really wanted to like this movie. It\'s based on a true story, I\'m a WWII history buff, and it had an amazing cast. The over-the-top silliness just ruined the movie for me. It removed all suspense, drama, sense of danger, etc. Why do they have to take stories that need no embellishment to be exciting and dramatic and turn them into a quasi-comedy? Even that was a failure...the comedy was not funny. I waited until the rental price for this came down to somewhat reasonable and decided to purchase it on amazon, believing that with the subject matter and cast, I would likely want to watch it more than once. Nope. To be frank, I found it boring. A 6/10 is generous.\n2 out of 2 found this helpful. Was this review helpful?

The dialog just seems to be stilted, fakey, and in at least one case wholly wrong - the story starts in 1942 and the character playing Churchill complains about America\'s reluctance to join the war effort. Humm, did they forget Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941 - I thought that date that will live in infamy! Maybe the main cast is too good looking to be believable, surely not all of the \"Ungentlemanly Warfare\" men were this handsome - maybe throw in an ordinary looking guy for variety. And they cast Eiza González as a Brit - really? So, I cannot give an enthusiastic thumbs up to this one, I can give a half-hearted one.

Many people lost their lives during this operation (which off course is exaggerated in the movie) and yet the film has a lighthearted narration which sees the soldiers cracking jokes whilst killing the enemy. This is indeed a very different approach but it allowed for a highly entertaining movie which is not to be taken too seriously, and that was funny and enjoyable instead of nail-biting suspense.\n\nI absolutely loved Henry Cavill here, in the role of Gus March-Phillips, who leads the operation. In fact, the entire cast was just brilliant and I also thoroughly enjoyed hunky Alan Ritchson as Anders Lassen. This character was so inventive when it came to killing people, he was an absolute delight to watch!\n\nSo, Gus March-Phillips is recruited to lead Operation Postmaster - a mission to cut off supplies to the German submarines in Nazi-controlled waters. Gus selects his own team, which consists of Henry, Freddy, and Anders. On their way, they rescue Geoffrey from captivity, and include him in their team.\n\nThen there are agents Marjorie and Heron, who is sent to the island of Fernando Po, so Marjorie can get close to Nazi Commander Heinrich Luhr in order to get information from him.\n\nThe film follows the team as they execute their daring and ambitious plans. With every obstacle, they have to devise a new and more daring plan, and it was a lot of fun to watch! There was a bit too much killing for my liking, but the action sequences are fantastic and in general the film is thoroughly entertaining. The cinematography is good, and the Oscar-worthy score is AWESOME!!

I know he\'s a guy who can grow to the size of a monster and often fights against kaijus. There is some sort of Kaiju Defense Force that also fights kaijus. Somehow, this film becomes the story of Ultraman defending a kaiju baby from the KDF, which is ironic, but kind of fun.\n\nHowever, the true strength (and weakness) of the movie is not in the monster battles, but in the story of a young man trying to juggle career, family, child raising and personal life at the same time. Did I want this in a Kaiju movie? Maybe not, but at the same time it was what gave the characters depth and the story emotional power.\n\nAlso, this is a kiddie film, designed to appeal to small children and their parents who, probably, try to juggle a lot of things too, so technically it was good product.\n4 out of 4 found this helpful.

The them fo family started off slow, but once I got to a certain point in the story, this story hit me hard with a lot of emotion. I also really enjoyed the journey of the main character of Ultraman in this movie. When you first meet Ultraman, he starts off as a selfish punk but as soon as he meets a certain character, he starts to grow and change into a much better person and hero. I also really liked the villain and he\'s one of those villains who really isn\'t a villain, he just a normal guy who\'s lost a lot in his life and he just wants to protect the people from the Kaiju even if that means he has do some horrible things. You can sympathize with him and his motivations, but he also needs to be stopped at the same time.

Even the antagonist\'s motivations are explored, adding depth to the narrative.\n\nFor those who grew up with Ultraman in the 80s, this movie is a nostalgic treat.

Here\'s a positive user review for the movie \"Ultraman: Rising\" that highlights the themes of parental love and the bond between Emi and Ken Sato:\n\n\"Ultraman: Rising\" is a delightful animated superhero fantasy that weaves together powerful themes of love, sacrifice, and family bonds. As viewers, we are treated to a heartwarming story that resonates with both parents and children alike.\n\nParental Love and Sacrifice: The film beautifully portrays the unwavering love of parents. Ken Sato, our baseball prodigy turned hero, grapples with his own past while caring for Emi, a baby kaiju. His determination to protect her mirrors the sacrifices parents make for their children.\n\nDr. Sato\'s guidance and Professor Sato\'s legacy emphasize the importance of family connections. Their love transcends time and space, echoing the universal truth that parents will move mountains for their kids.\n\nEmi and Ken\'s Bond: Emi, the adorable Gigantron hatchling, steals our hearts. Her innocence and vulnerability evoke empathy, and her attachment to Ken (alias Ultraman) tugs at our emotions.\n\nKen\'s journey from arrogance to responsibility is intertwined with Emi\'s growth. Their bond deepens as they navigate parenthood together, proving that family extends beyond bloodlines.\n\nVisual Brilliance: The animation dazzles, especially during epic battles between kaijus. Vibrant colors and dynamic sequences keep us engaged.\n\nEmi\'s cocoon and transformation are visually captivating, symbolizing rebirth and hope-a testament to the film\'s underlying themes.\n\nLessons for All Ages: \"Ultraman: Rising\" isn\'t just for kids; it\'s a reminder for adults too. We learn that heroism lies not only in physical strength but also in emotional resilience and compassion.\n\nKen\'s reconciliation with his father and his realization that being a hero means finding balance resonate with anyone who\'s struggled with multiple roles.\n\nIn summary, \"Ultraman: Rising\" is a heartwarming adventure that celebrates love, family, and the extraordinary bonds that connect us all. Whether you\'re a parent, a child, or an Ultraman fan, this film will leave you with a smile and a renewed appreciation for the power of love.

The boy has chops. Here he plays Monkey Man, an underground street fighter just striving to make a living in the slums of India but with a burning desire for vengeance. As the film progresses we are slowly introduced to both the target(s) of his vengeance and the reasons he is crippled by it.\n\nYou\'ve seen this all before in a hundred films of its type but this has enough style and substance to it to stand out from the rest. The fights scenes (especially as the film progresses and our protagonist improves) are dynamic and kinetic, the camera never stops moving. But there are enough quiet, still, thoughtful moments here to raise this film above the usual chaff. The flashback scenes are filled with warmth and beauty and show a real eye as a director. The film uses music exceptionally well to add both gravitas and levity to scenes where needed.\n\nWith influences from western cinema, Indian cinema and especially 90s East Asian action flicks this film has enough pace and action for the fight movie fans but also enough of a story and heart for the general movie goer. You\'ll be rooting for our eponymous Monkey Man to get his vengeance. As I said a really excellent directorial debut from an already established young, proper movie star.

Monkey Man is the first movie I\'ve gone to see in the theaters in a very long time. I just don\'t get interested enough to not wait for it to be streaming.\n\nMonkey Man compelled me to go. It\'s probably the best movie trailer I\'ve ever seen, or at least one of the best.\n\nThe problem with the trailer that I foresee is many are going to walk out of the theater feeling misled.\n\nIf you\'re an action movie fan, DO NOT GO SEE THIS IN THEATERS. Wait for streaming. This is a drama with elements of action and crime thriller. Anyone going in who thinks this is like John Wick will be sorely disappointed. The problem is, that\'s the impression the trailer gives.\n\nI\'m actually not even a John Wick fan. I like action movies, but I don\'t seek them out often. What I thought could make Monkey Man special was the added substance of Indian mythology, culture, and a more fleshed out character drama that was hinted at in the trailer.\n\nSome of that was present, but it didn\'t come together nearly as well as I had hoped. I don\'t agree with the severe criticism of the action scenes and how they were filmed. I thought they were good and the shaky cam didn\'t bother me. Could it have been better? Probably. But I think the criticism there is overblown.\n\nWhere the film missed its mark for me was the story itself. The first act was good, but in the second act it ground to a halt for 40 minutes or so of more of what we already learned in act 1, at the expense of pacing. Some parts were fleshed out way too much while other parts weren\'t fleshed out enough, making it feel off almost the whole movie. The supporting characters didn\'t get enough of this, which didn\'t help us care about them and also care about them joining the fight with our protagonist.\n\nI\'m genuinely surprised at some of Dev\'s choices in Act 2. I actually admire him for trying to make a movie with more substance that could be called action to some degree, but I just think he didn\'t nail the blend of these things with Monkey Man. You could argue that he tried to do too much. There was a significant amount of extended flashback used throughout even up to the very end. This ended up taking us out of the present and hurting the flow of the story.\n\nI think Monkey Man as Dev Patel envisioned it might have been much better as a limited series. So that he could take his time and flesh everything out the way he wanted. Because again, there were some great elements in this movie. Good acting, good cinematography, good music (although it sounds as if it was more stereotypical Indian music and other cultural elements used), some great fight scene moments, and some fun bits. It just doesn\'t add up to a great movie.\n\nSomeone else mentioned they felt detached a bit, and I agree. Despite the protagonist\'s story having the right emotional elements to draw us in, it didn\'t do it as much I had hoped for me.\n\nWhat I envision is a lot of people going into this expecting a pure action thrill ride, and they\'re going to be bored.

Monkey Man also suffers from erratic pacing, with lulls in the action that go on for a tad too long. If Patel had had the confidence to shoot his fight scenes in a less chaotic manner and had kept the pace more consistent, I think the film would have been better for it.\n\nThat said, I didn\'t dislike the movie as a whole - Patel does well in his role as avenging angel and the level of violence is impressive. I definitely had far more fun with Monkey Man than either of the other two big screen releases I have seen recently: Ghostbusters: Frozen Empire and Godzilla x Kong, both of which were hugely disappointing.'),(244,14,'6/10','You can tell it\'s a directorial debut','usierpinska','20 April 2024','You can tell this was Dev Patel\'s first time directing because it feels like he refused to cut any scene from it in the interest of keeping the story engaging. The second hour of the movie could have been 20 minutes. There was no longer any plot, you knew exactly what was going to happen from the midpoint, you just didn\'t realize it was going to take over an hour of pensive looks and Dev punching 200 people. The best way I can describe it is if that scene from John Wick where he takes forever to get up the stairs and then he\'s right at the top and tumbles down? Imagine if that was half the movie.

The quality of the action choreography and original fight scenes, and the ratio of backstory/reason for revenge to actually getting revenge. What made John Wick the pinnacle of revenge movies is how they masterfully build a world during action sequences, spending only the first 1% of the movie establishing his reason for revenge and then taking you for a thrill ride of artfully choreographed violence. Monkey Man sadly is not the Indian John Wick because where John wick does more with very little, Monkey Man conversely takes the opposite approach essentially dividing the film into two acts. The first half of the movie, roughly accounting for 65% of the duration of the 2 hour film consists of backstory, reason for revenge, and without spoiling anything, setbacks.\n\nA successful revenge movie understands that pacing is the sharpest blade. There may be setbacks. But they don\'t set back the pace as the movie always inches forward towards revenge.\n\nWhile it is true that it is possible to enhance the satisfaction of revenge by focusing more on the reason for that revenge, this is extremely difficult to do and in almost all cases ends up causing the movie to drag. This was very much the case with Monkey Man, or as my title refers to it - Monkey Marathon.\n\nMonkey Man has elements of what it needs to be to achieve a John Wick level of action film, but it goes in the completely wrong direction.

There is some \"shaky cam,\" but not too much to ruin the experience.

The action was so poorly shot which is such an unforgivable sin for me. It was full of jarring cuts, shaky camera work, and disorientating pans and whips. Dev Patel clearly wanted a very kinetic and vibrant approach but it just wasn\'t executed well for me. This is such a shame as when the camera work did settle down the action was violent and gritty and could have been something really special. The stunt work all looked good, it just wasn\'t presented well at all.\n\nIn terms of the story there isn\'t much to complain about. I\'ve seen so many films of this ilk and Monkey Man doesn\'t necessarily stand out too much. Some side plots and characters added a little variety, but ultimately the story was fairly generic. Nothing great but nothing awful.\n\nThen there was the lead performance from Dev Patel which again I was left a tad underwhelmed by. He\'s a brilliant actor and considering he was directing I thought he\'d really shine in this project, but he just failed to really draw me in as something was missing from his performance. None of the other characters were developed enough to particularly comment on their performances.\n\nOne of the strengths of the film though is probably the look of the whole thing. There are some good creative choices in the sets, lighting etc, that do create a vibrancy and energy which worked well.\n\nWith so many great films in this genre like John Wick, Taken, Nobody etc, there needed to be something in this film to really stand out.

Patel plays Kid, a.k.a. Monkey Man as many call him, with absolute persision. He embodies the character with such emotion, not many others could possibly think of playing him. While you won\'t hear much dialogue from Kid, he really expresses himself in his actions and you learn a lot about him as a person through these. In this situation, his actions speak louder then his words. While he does seem to a very original character, he does feel a bit too much inspired by John Wick which may lower the value of the film for some.\n\nMonkey Man, when it comes to violence and gore, dosen\'t hold back and goes completely unhinged, using nearly anything it can find as a weapon. While at some points it does feel somewhat excessive and unnecessary, especially in the final act, it is very well performed and cherographed but the visuals may be a bit much, even for the non-squimish. And at points it does feel its overshadowing a great story. Monkey Man could hit a lot more harder if they delved further into the story and lore, as well as the political situation that takes a main part through the story.\n\nOverall, Monkey Man is certainly not for those at all squimish but Patel\'s very strong performance and direction makes this one I would definitely recommend seeing this in a theatre and you might end up wanting to give it a rewatch.'),(261,14,'7/10','?Indian John Wick?','leestoych','4 April 2024','\"Only God can forgive you now\"\n\nMan.

It\'s fast paced editing matched the chaotic streets of India, mixed with its rich culture and history.\n\nThe soundtrack was reminiscent of John Wick, with it\'s party scenes and colour palette.

It feels like the MAD MAX film that George Miller always wanted to make, and in many ways it\'s a virtual remake of MAD MAX 2: THE ROAD WARRIOR, except with a grossly inflated budget and CGI effects used to enhance rather than dominate. Now, I love THE ROAD WARRIOR and always will, but MAD MAX: FURY ROAD truly is an action film for our times.\n\nI know that some will hate it; the story here is action and action alone and there\'s little else to get in the way. It\'s one long chase film and the amazing thing is how they manage to sustain the momentum for a good two hours. Exemplary cinematography and quite wonderful direction is what makes this work. With bad direction it would have been a real chore to sit through, but instead we get tons of suspense, great fight scenes, and incredible spectacle. This is the kind of film you watch to see stuff that\'s never been done before.\n\nTom Hardy feels like an obvious fit for the role and brings some working class style charisma to the part. As many have commented, Max is often a supporting player in his own film, but Charlize Theron as the real lead is excellent too, so that\'s not important. Even Nicholas Hoult in support is fantastic. I loved the way that the bad guy is played by Hugh Keays-Byrne, who was the villain in the first MAD MAX all those years ago.

(9.5/10)','isaacsuttle','14 May 2015','George Miller returns to live-action filmmaking with one of the greatest action films ever put to screen. \'Mad Max: Fury Road\' is ridiculous in all the right ways.\n\nFor those who have seen the original films and loved them, you\'ll fall in love all over again with this film. Tom Hardy takes the reigns this time around as Max - a man of few words who has been hardened by the world in which he lives. Along with him is Charlize Theron as Imperator Furiosa - a woman who seeks redemption by helping five young \'\"wives\" escape from the film\'s antagonist.\n\nLeading up to the film\'s release, many speculated if this would be just another action film that lacks a solid narrative and motive, but I am happy to say that this is simply not the case. Yes, the film does fill 80% of its run-time with action sequences, but it never gets in the way of the humanity between these characters that Miller has brought to life. There are some emotional moments. Specifically, with Theron\'s character. Is the story something we haven\'t seen before? Not at all. But in a film loaded with action, it\'s nice to see a solid narrative.\n\nNow, how about those action sequences? Incredible - exhilarating - jaw-dropping. George Miller has put together some of the greatest, most memorable action set-pieces ever. One thing that sets the action in this film apart from a good majority of mediocre action films today is that every action the character\'s make have an affect on them. For good and for bad. The action is not pointless. It\'s motivated. And it\'s glorious to behold thanks to the use of practical effects, incredible stunt work and stunning cinematography.\n\n\'Mad Max: Fury Road\' has set a new standard for action films. It\'s arguably the greatest action film of the 21st century. It\'s that good. George Miller has brought back what we loved about 80\'s action films while also brining new ideas to the table. It\'s the best time I\'ve had in a theater in a long time, and I couldn\'t help but laugh in appreciation of the ridiculousness that was unfolding before my eyes. The film left me feeling giddy, with a big smile on my face.'),(268,15,'10/10','Mad Max Fury Road: A statement to embarrass and destroy all other movies in the action genre','confrank','16 May 2015','Mad Max: Fury Road, starring Tom Hardy and Charlize Theron, is George Miller\'s attempt to reignite his long dormant Mad Max franchise...and my god does he ever. For the past decade or so, with exceptions such as John Wick, The Bourne Trilogy, and The Raid, action movies seem to be struggling to capture the excitement and enjoyment the genre once held; a tenacity that classics from the 80\'s and 90\'s had in spades. George Miller single handedly delivers our saving grace with Fury Road on the back of a spike covered oil rig with a blind zombie playing a fire breathing electric guitar.\n\nMax is a man of few words, but Tom Hardy\'s talent for portraying strong, silent characters shines through in a gruff but sympathetic performance. He teams up with Charlize Theron\'s Imperator Furiosa to save the last 5 hot women in the world from the leader of a powerful cult with a terrifying breathing mask inspired by the Cheshire Cat from Alice in Wonderland. From there, the chase is on.\n\nUsing this simple plot as the setting, we are able to bear witness to one of the most beautifully shot films in years. The world of Mad Max looks absolutely gorgeous, combining awe-inspiring practical effects and landscapes with bold colours brimming from all edges of the frame. These are of course just bonuses in enhancing the primary reason people will love this film, the action itself. I\'m happy to report these action sequences are damn near flawless. No shaky cam, barely a hint of CGI, and scenes where we actually feel like our characters are in danger (yes Furious 7 I\'m calling you out). Total chaos relentlessly ensues for the majority of the film, but it\'s chaos you can follow clearly and marvel at. Whether it\'s one of the explosive car sequences, or one of the smaller emotional moments, Mad Max: Fury Road refuses to let up on tension for one second.\n\nThere\'s a reason this movie is sitting at 98% on Rotten Tomatoes. This is an action movie that will set a precedent for years to come, roaring ferociously at all who may challenge it. Hopefully, this is only the beginning of a genre revolution early in the making.\n\nFINAL VERDICT: Mad Max: Fury Road is a beautifully chaotic display of masterfully executed action sequences with a strong emotional core, and a raw energy unmatched by nearly all of its action genre competition.'),(269,15,'CalRhys','What A Lovely Day!','25 May 2015','Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.','The rationale behind the success of \'Fury Road\' predominantly lies with director George Miller whose commitment and love for the film series that he\'s been developing since its first outing in 1979 is evident throughout, and it\'s pretty obvious that he knows how to craft a damn fine action sequence. Without this passion, the film would have likely stooped as there\'s not much else in the way of a plot or character development, even though Theron tries her hardest to give us an enthralling new action heroine to be revered. Aside from the aforementioned writing setbacks, \'Fury Road\' is a powerhouse in the technical categories. With stunning contradictory cinematography from John Seale giving us a post-apocalyptic world of lavish colour rather than your typical muted tones, a heart-pounding score from Junkie XL and exquisite production design work that rightfully earnt the film an Oscar (one of six) for its spectacular vehicle design.\n365 out of 612 found this helpful.

Riveting from top to bottom and filled with white-knuckle action that is so gorgeous to look at that I can sparsley find the proper verbiage. Hands down incredible film. The acting, score, and direction is all top notch. Almost no other action movie can hold a candle to Fury Road.\n\n\"What a day, what a lovely day!\"\n\nThis story strike a unique balance between simple story beats and sprawling themes.

Mad Max: Fury Road is the finest blockbuster of 2015!','ivo-cobra8','3 October 2015','When I wrote this review 3 years ago I had no idea how many people hate this movie and they are preferring Mad Max 3 over this film. Claming Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome the third film is better film than this, really? Better than this? Listen folks it has no Mel Gibson so what? So what\'s your point? Gibson dropped out this film and he wasn\'t interested, it was in development for years, since in 2004 this movie was announced. George Miller did something different with this film and he got hate for it. I hate Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome to death! It is rated PG-13 family film and I wanted an action bloody rated R film not a boring stupid lame fu**** movie! I got an rated R bloody action film that I wanted in Mad Max: Fury Road. I was entertained and I enjoy it.\n\nAt least it wasn\'t so sick like was Beyond Thunderdome. Mad Max: Fury Road is my second favorite film in the franchise and this movie did it right and it correct that third film that it failed been an good action film. Like it or hate it, is your problem but in my opinion it is a good action violent movie and I love it to death I am an action junkie myself. Mad Max 2: The Road Warrior is my number 1 favorite film of all time.\n\nI think Mad Max: Fury Road is George Miller\'s masterpiece. Finally, Finally after 30.years of fiasco Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome that completely destroyed the Mad Max Trilogy, George Miller finally come back and fix the mistake he did 30.years ago. Why wouldn\'t I love this film? This film is the best one in the series along side Mad Max 2: The Road Warrior at least for me it is the best film. It has action, high explosive and Tom Hardy been a real Mad Max unlike Mel Gibson was in Thunderdome. I am happy they made the 4th movie. Tom Hardy was a bad ass Mad Max. I didn\'t even noticed that we don\'t have Mel Gibson in here. Tom Hardy breaths life into Max Rockatansky and Charlize Theron is excellent and emotionally perfect as Furiosa. I love high speed and pursuit on a road which I seriously love this. The thing was more similar to Mad Max 2: The Road Warrior but much better, George Miller fix it, the film did not copy The Road Warrior the film has it is own story. All, the stunts and action sequences are SPECTACULAR. Immortan Joe was a fantastic villain in here he was really good. The film shows a real wasteland and the future which I am really happy about it.\n\nNOTE: \"Don\'t waste your time if you have seen the original.\" from a hater review my reply: Yes I will waste my time watching this awesome action flick! Yes I have seen the Original Film Mad Max with Mel Gibson so many times than you ever did! I love this film much more than Mad Max because sometimes the original is very boring and the film has so much Drama in it and less Action than it is in Fury Road. I wanted to have an apocalyptic action film like are Fury Road and The Road Warrior which this film fix it. Finally yes Finally I have seen a good Action Film from 2015 and It is finally the finest blockbuster of 2015!\n\nMad Max: Fury Road is a 2015 post-apocalyptic action film directed and produced by George Miller, and written by Miller, Brendan McCarthy and Nico Lathouris.

People complaining that there is a lack of story and character development, and too much action.... too much action? Really? Have these people never seen a Mad Max movie before? How is that a bad thing in a Mad Max movie? Fury Road feels like an 80\'s action movie, with a preposterously large budget, and it is GLORIOUS. This movie was an epic ride. So many awesome set pieces, incredible car designs, twisted and bizarre costumes and characters, and a lot of really strong warrior women as well.\n\nI\'ve also heard it said that this movie contains a lot of feminism. Strong female characters that kick butt, is not feminism people! There\'s no anti-men message here. Just a cast which is dominated by more women than men. And about time for a change! Charlize Theron is my new favorite actress after this (it used to be Sigourney Weaver and Linda Hamilton). She really takes the spotlight, and that is about the only criticism I can think of with this movie. It\'s not so much about Mad Max, but about road warriors in general, and specifically Theron\'s character. I didn\'t think Tom Hardy was quite as good as Mad Max as Mel Gibson was, but he wasn\'t terrible. He just didn\'t lend enough presence to his character in this movie. Which may be a hard thing to do when the movie does not focus on Max.\n\nSpecial mention should also be given to all the side characters. The villains are enjoyably menacing, especially Hugh Keays-Byrne as Immortan Joe, John Howard as the People Eater, Richard Carter as the Bullet Farmer, and I also loved Melissa Jaffer as the leader of a gang of elderly motor ladies.\n\nGo see this movie if you like Mad Max!'),(273,15,'6/10','2-hour action scene','akdjreview','28 December 2021','The concept of the Mad Max films is incredible.

It\'s based on the plot of driving a straight line for half the movie. Then realising they cant continue to then turn around, and drive back for the rest of the film. Meanwhile basically being on constant fight scenes along the way. Even so, most fight scenes are quite poorly filmed. The director used odd angles.

I will start by saying this movie was absolutely batsh** insane. It was filled right to the brim with continuous over the top bloody ridiculous action sequences that keep you on the edge of the seat and just amazed at what Is happening on screen. Now this film doesn\'t have much of a plot at all but seriously you\'re not going into this film for an intense plot, this is a film that almost didn\'t even need one at all. The one thing I was worried about going in was whether I needed to have seen the previous films to understand this one and thankfully you don\'t, the story is independent of the previous film which was really helpful.\n\nThe characters were all awesome and it did an amazing job to introduce them all almost instantly and get right into the action. Max (Tom Hardy? and Furiosa (Charlize Theron) were were great and extremely likable characters. Even the villain who I will just call Sweet Tooth was so great, he wasn\'t anything too special but was a great threat throughout the film.\n\nI just absolutely loved this movie, intense action from start to finish and didn\'t slow down at all, that made it ridiculously fun to watch. The great characters and the performances are awesome on screen and we\'re always interesting to watch. If there was ever a Twisted Metal movie, this is what it would be.

It may be the best Mad Max film from a story perspective, and almost definitely the best from a technical perspective.\n\nAs far as the pre-production work goes, the smooth camera focus from shot to shot, the frantic way scenes are filmed, the risky and flawless stunt choreography, the vehicle designs, costumes, and settings are all executed and established brilliantly. For the post-production work, the filters for day and night are awe-inspiring, with the night being so uniquely illuminated and the day looking so otherworldly yet familiar with the colours standing out and blending simultaneously as well as how the explosions appearing as if they\'re bleeding into the screen. The CGI effects are used sparingly and effectively, looking as convincing as they need to be. The score supports the thrills and emotions present throughout in the terrifyingly insane world the characters inhabit. Speaking of, the performances are all top notch, no particular favourites as everyone seemed to be doing their part wonderfully, from the main players like Max and Furiosa to the side characters like Slit and Rictus, everyone. The story is essentially one big escape and pursuit, executed in an effectively efficient manner.\n\nHonestly aside from one or two easily overlooked plotholes there\'s nothing I can really say to discredit this movie. The only thing I could say is that Max doesn\'t really feel like the main character until closer to the end of the movie but that\'s kinda just it.\n\nOverall, I\'m probably not thinking of everything I enjoyed about this film, but that\'s just because there is so much to love.

The acting was great, especially from Charlize Theron and Tom Hardy of course.

Watching it again at home isn\'t quite as powerful, but stills being fantastic. From the very beginning to the last scene, I was completely immersed in this wild and intense world created by George Miller. I think this movie is a real masterpiece, and it\'s not hard to see why.\n\nThe cinematography is breathtaking, the best I\'ve seen in an action movie. Every scene is carefully shot and choreographed, resulting in a visual spectacle that\'s simply stunning. The deserts, cars, costumes, character looks, and color contrasts make this world unforgettable. It\'s one of those rare movies where every frame could be in an art gallery.\n\nThe soundtrack is amazing, taking the action to a whole new level. Every beat drives the story and the intensity of the action scenes, pumping up the excitement to the max. It\'s a truly unforgettable auditory experience.\n\nAnd as for the story, I\'d call it simple but spectacular. George Miller tells an exciting tale at a fast pace that never lets the audience rest. From the moment the action kicks off to the climax, there\'s not a dull moment. It\'s a rollercoaster that keeps us glued to the screen from start to finish.\n\nBut it\'s in the action scenes where the movie really shines. They\'re all simply epic, the most mind-blowing I\'ve ever seen in cinema. The fight choreography and the car chases are masterful and breathtaking. Every stunt and explosion is done in an unmatched way.\n\nIn the end, \"Mad Max: Fury Road\" is more than just an action movie; it\'s an example of how to create a true cinematic masterpiece. It\'s one of those rare films that manages to be both visually stunning and narratively engaging.

From the get go, there\'s action and it is long, and masterfully executed. It does what every action movie should do. The action keeps you on the edge of your seats biting on your nails the whole time. Also the background score was very well composed and really immersed us in the movie. You can\'t expect too much character development from an action movie but this movie manages to excel in that regard too.

It can be hard to describe indeed.... but I\'ll go for it... Sheer madness that isn\'t sullied by bad acting or laughable lines. A blockbuster that is gritty and doesn\'t have a sense of humour that could be equated to a fluffy kitten. No \'lets all hug\' sentimental BS. This is seriously a movie I thought I\'d never see: a CGI-filled blockbuster that I flat out loved. The stunts are so much fun, the FX so great, it is the first movie I have seen where I have thoroughly enjoyed all this type of stuff - probably because the cinematography for once doesn\'t suffer cos of it. It is all incredibly shot. The action is so brutal and appropriately high-octane. I thought to myself more than once, \'I think I am loving this more than Terminator 2\' but other than that, there wasn\'t time to think. It kicked off fast and barely stopped, and the lulls were amplified by the insanity preceding them. Plus it is a dark film, which made it even better. I many people do an Aussie accent even close to well, was Hardy actually trying for that? Either way, he didn\'t talk much so it didn\'t really matter. This is more Theron\'s movie than Hardy\'s, he doesn\'t say much and does next to nothing for the first third or so. Theron\'s Furiosa is more of the hero is the story, if there were to be a hero in such a grisly and dark world. I don\'t even like this type of movie but the execution is everything.

The film is a gripping full adrenaline race across the desert of a post-apocalyptic future. The action sequences are mesmerizing and the work of a true master craftsman in action. What is perhaps the most enthralling part of the film is the absolutely absurd story and world building. Miller created a fantasy world where men playing flame throwing guitars and leaping through high speed chases on pull-vaults seems like a typical milk run. The movie keeps a relentless action pace that makes all of the absurdity seem so completely ordinary, which might be the real magic of this movie. This is only really possible because the action, filmography, set choices and music are so brilliant you cannot help but believe the insanity that plays out before you. You want to believe the fiction because of the quality of the production. The movie also features some surprisingly good performances.

First of all, the stunts and action sequences are SPECTACULAR. Tom Hardy breaths life into Max Rockatansky and Charlize Theron is excellent and emotionally perfect as Furiosa. The story opens, with Immortan Joe who has young ladies as his wives, but he\'ll goes down when they escape the sadist\'s hands. Max, who has a violent past with Joe\'s cronies, decides to help Imperior Furiosa take the girls somewhere safe. Furiosa can\'t trust Max, and neither can he. So it all comes down to Joe\'s cronies fighting against them reaching to their destination. The movie is a bananas car chase for the runtime, as Max and Furiosa work together to fight against the evils. And then, there is Nux, a bonkers \"really skin coloured\" guy, who works with Joe, played well by Nicholas Hoult. The 3D really pays off, and is worth the extra ticket. The movie puts all other action movies of shame, the effects really pop out. Well, this is a definite masterpiece. One of the best movies of the year, one of the best action movies ever made and the role of Theron\'s life. Miller is truly a mastermind as stated clearly in the trailer.

But my old fashioned \"There needs to be a story and interesting characters\" mode took over. It took about fifteen minutes to figure out who was who. Apparently, the guy with the death mask and the tubes was seen as a god, that there was some religious following. Could be interesting, I guess. But what follows is one chase after another with every conceivable vehicle that some guy could dream up. There were porcupine cars. Monster trucks. Guys on poles dropping into vehicles. There was no logic presented as to why one vehicle would have a spear thing thrown at it and explode while others were hit with heavy artillery and seemed to move on just fine. Then we have Mad Max who is a captive with a mask that looks like a 1955 Oldsmobile grill. He is put on the front of a vehicle as all this combat goes on. Unfortunately, he has absolutely no personality whatsoever. There was never any suspense in this film because the place they were trying to get to was never really in our mind\'s eye.

My opinion of the first two in this series (Godzilla and Godzilla: King of the Monsters) is that they were (somewhat) reality based and not obviously made for children. My criticism of G v K (the ending in particular) and this movie is that so much of it is far-fetched and fantasy based. Much more cartoonish.\n\nThe bottom line is, they\'re making the monsters out to have too much human intelligence when they should actually be more animalistic. This was like watching a superhero movie and in my opinion, making the monsters out to be superheroes is a huge mistake. That\'s what happened when Toho did this in the 60\'s/70\'s which resulted in Godzilla movies becoming silly, low-budget kids movies, which has since been ridiculed for decades and has tarnished Godzilla\'s image. I understand the writers are trying to be creative and give the fans something different from all of the other monster movies out there, but this can be done without all the cheese.

Luckily, I wasn\'t disappointed, I got everything what I expected which might be summoned by the two equations above.\n\nAbout humans: If you want to watch the movie at home, don\'t waste time on humans subplot. It\'s completely pointless. The dialogues aren\'t funny or smart. They serve poor exposition which is painfully exhausting to watch. You see the monsters fighting and these \"characters\" are explaining in between: oh, he is protecting! - Come on, who wrote this? In my opinion if Legendary Studios wants to include humans, they should at least try making them just little interesting or just remove them completely. None of them is doing anything necessary, furthermore whatever they\'re doing doesn\'t make any sense. Why the hell are they in the Hollow Earth without protection? One guy is just in a Hawaiian shirt. The amount of dangerous monsters is not alarming, I guess... Paper Boy is filming everything but the British guy in a Hawaiian shirt says something like: It\'s better to keep it in a secret, this ancient civilization shouldn\'t be exposed to our world. The girl from Godzilla Vs. Kong (she is from that world and has weird X-Men power (?)) is among modern people, so the world already knows the underground world. What does he want to hide? There is more of this stupidity.\n\nAbout the monsters: Kong is the lead. His journey is simple, he feels lonely, he wants to have a family of his kind. From the trailers you know, there is more giant apes, so I am happy to see them because I am Team Kong :) I\'d want to appreciate the \"dialogues\" between Kong and this little ginger fella. They don\'t use words as we do but believe me, these two are more interesting than the humans. You will enjoy it.\n\nGodzilla and the rest are just monsters. Sadly Godzilla isn\'t intimidating in this movie, his only goal is to gain the pink level of nuclear power and then use it to fight the bad monkey. However, the fight scenes are awesome - this is why we are watching this type of movies, so if you\'re a fan of giant monsters, I recommend Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire... and don\'t expect to see raise of \"the new empire\" in this movie.

And lastly, the Titans were back to being the bad guys instead of humans. I always find it a bore when you watch a movie about monsters fighting, but have to bare through a story of human villains and their idiotic ideologies.\n\nA side note, it\'s hilarious that these Titans seem to really enjoy having their royal rumbles in the biggest cities on the planet, or while destroying some of the world\'s most revered structures.

Adam Wingard\'s second Monsterverse film following 2021\'s \"Godzilla vs Kong\" delivers satisfying Titan action, but overall, the film feels like a step back, largely owing to dull and tedious human drama.\n\nPersonally, I found \"Godzilla vs Kong\" to be the best Monsterverse film. It embraced the absurdity and silliness of its premise and made the most of it to deliver one hell of a show, placing the Titans front and centre, while jettisoning any unnecessary human drama. \"Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire\" starts off much slower, with the actual plot taking nearly 20 minutes to kick in. Combined with an uptick in uninteresting human drama, this slows down the movie with certain portions feeling boring.\n\nMuch like its predecessor, \"Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire\" struggles trying to the connect the stories of the two leading titans. Kong is the heart and soul of the movie, with Godzilla largely feeling like an accomplice or sidekick. The first half of the movie is almost entirely about Kong\'s exploration of Hollow Earth, the subterranean ecosystem where the Titans live. While learning about the mystical world was engaging and intriguing, it lead to a delayed introduction of the villain, leading to the third act feeling slightly rushed and less rewarding compared to the enthralling finale of \"Godzilla vs Kong\".\n\nThe action sequences themselves are a whole lot of fun, with a face off in hollow earth with gravity slightly messed-up being one of my favourites of the entire franchise. The finale in Rio delivers plentiful excitement and fun too.\n\n\"Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire\" is best suited for fans of the Showa era. For Kong fans(like myself), there is a lot to like about the movie, owing to the humanisation of the great ape. The action scenes are fun, colourful and campy, similar to it\'s predecessor, but an increased focus on human characters and a slower pace make this a slightly underwhelming entry to the Monsterverse.'),(290,16,'6/10','This movie should be called Monkey X Kong, which is more appropriate','harryxianjy','31 March 2024','The movie features very few scenes with Godzilla, only a few fragmented shots, including the final battle.

The movie is filled with monkeys throughout, making it more like an independent Kong film because it barely depicts Godzilla, with Kong having far more screen time than Godzilla. I feel like Godzilla\'s role was forcefully added and feels disconnected from the rest of the movie.

Except annoyance dumb rehashed mcu jokes, not even remotely amusing. Not even in the same league as the masterpiece like Godzilla minus 1. This will be my last one of these types of Godzilla movies they toss out tripe like this on a regular basis like EA churns out GaaS games that ultimately get shut down within a year. Why because they are poop. The Cranston one was good, then the Farminga one wasn\'t bad, though the milly brown family aspect made it cringe. Soon as we got to the ones with ms hall and skarsgard they went down the pan and in the gutter. All flashy bright colors felt like we were watching iron man. Such a shame because Godzilla Kong and the creatures really tried to carry the human cast. But every scene these collection of humans were in we wanted them to meet a grizzly end.

The jokes land a bit better this time around. The aura & creative decisions in this film have almost an 80\'s vintage vibrant feel, the music & color palette compliment each other perfectly along with cinematography.\n\nMy issues? Well... why does the movie have Monarch being okay with bringing anybody down to hollow earth? Reliance on slight jumpy exposition, small things that could have been explored a little more to leave more an impact. It\'s not perfect for those, however I will argue this film was a lot closer to striking close to being perfect than you would think a film of this caliber could do.\n\nThis is what happens when Cinematography, awareness, consistency & finding the footing on following Kaijus, gets the best of a cinematic experience, it\'s just as much a kaiju story as it is a human story & It\'s a Love Letter to the showa era & fans should be proud.\n\nI\'ve never been more invested in the actual story of the kaijus until this movie, expositions & humans don\'t ruin it either this time. It\'s not anything special, but what is special are what we are here for, & that\'s the Kaijus.\n\nNew Empire, by far, has the longest showtime for Kaiju action that I\'ve ever seen in a monster flick. Beautifully shot cinematic camera scenes, there is one specific upside down shot unfolding to the right side up, just amazing camerawork\n\nThe gradual building blocks embedded in the story left exciting awe in entertainment & care of handling Kaiju moments. The humans are just enhancers for the monsters.

Now the thing is, the reason I am saying wow, is for a few big reasons that can probably relate to a lot of regular humans like me because I am most definitely human and not Godzilla trying to promote his own film. The reasons being; CGI, Big monster go rahh, and epic battle scenes. Anything else is boring and I frankly could care less about in this film because it affects nothing and all I care about are the things that THE FILM IS ACTUALLY ABOUT (humans).\n\nFirst, I wanna start off by saying that comparing this film\'s CGI to Godzilla Minus One (greatest Godzilla film that actually made me care about humans), budget wise, is like an insult. GMO had a budget near abouuuut 20 million or so, while GXK had 10x the budget. GMO managed to achieve winning an Oscar with 100x less visual art employees and having the best and probably the most realistic large scale CGI I\'ve seen ever. BUT, the CGI even with such a smaller film beating it, is still excellent as always and doesn\'t look like some PS5 game that was reprogrammed to run on a Nintendo Switch, unlike other films. It has definitely been one of the consecutive aspects of the MonsterVerse.\n\nMonsters; I\'m a sucker for Godzilla, not so much Kong, but this version of him definitely catches my eye. Godzilla and Shimo were what really brought this film together, and the funny thing is, before I saw Godzilla with pink atomic breath, it was my most disliked color, but on him, it\'s my preferred look for him. I also already loved cold related things so a big beast like Shimo definitely made me see this film.\n\nBattle Scenes. Now I know, I know, not all Godzilla films can entirely be epic fight scenes, I\'M JUST SAYING, I wish they were longer. They are definitely what everyone, including me, came to see, and I am beyond glad with the outcome of the film, that I totally didn\'t see coming (that\'s sarcasm), and I actually would love to see more of the franchise, whatever it may be. Also to anyone who disliked the movement speed of Godzilla, watch literally any dated Godzilla film.\n\nIn summary, I love Godzilla, Dune Part Two and GMO still beat it by an inconceivable number, but if you like big monsters or just Godzilla in General, watch this, maybe watch it again, or just watch the fight scene clips.'),(299,16,'6/10','Truly mind damaging experience','shibolleth','19 May 2024','Something is very wrong with American film making for some time.

The soundtrack not only enhances the emotional depth of the film but also succeeds in creating in some moments genuine goosebumps. The sound design really enhances this impact by carefully using sound pans, bass, and reverse effects. It creates a sense of tension and immersion which is one of the film\'s strongest features.\n\nThe Mixed:\n\nVisual Effects and Costume Design: Some of the visual effects in \"Madame Web\" were visually appealing. The costume design, like Casey\'s red jacket and the three spider girl villain outfits standing out as particularly stunning contributions to the film\'s aesthetic, but it was not often shown in the film since the films direction and focus was different. I was disappointed.\n\nActing and Direction: Although I thought Casey\'s character development - her ability to see the world from a different perspective - was great, I didn\'t like how it was visually presented. The way it was edited was poorly done. The editor could use 2 distinct color grading features where one sees the future and two, she sees the present moment.\n\nHowever, The performances throughout the film feel lackluster, with the actors appearing confused and disengaged. This, combined with direction that fails to maintain interest or coherence in many scenes, significantly undermines the film\'s potential.\n\nNegatives:\n\nCinematography: Cinematography is bad since some pictures don\'t show a clear image. The camera moves so fast that I cannot comprehend the picture. I kind of recognized that it tries to initiate the rapidness of the events from the spider\'s eye point of view but it was a tasteless decision. The Cinematography is not something like wow. The reason why Cinematography was lacking is because it was heavily based on medium closeups and dutch tilts which on one hand was a unique choice but on the other hand very hard to watch. I found the 180 degree round camera rotations super cool, but again, I expected varied distance shots, not just medium shots. The train scene Cinematography was the best in the film.\n\nEditing and Pace: The editing is arguably the weakest element of \"Madame Web,\" with its rapid cuts and disjointed flow detracting significantly from the storytelling. This lack of coherence makes it challenging for the audience to fully engage with the narrative.\n\nPlot and Overall Execution: The storyline of \"Madame Web\" is cluttered and clichéd, suffering from a lack of originality and clear direction. The film\'s ambition is evident, but the execution falls short of creating a compelling narrative.\n\nThe Conclusion:\n\n\"Madame Web\" presents a paradoxical experience, with exceptional music and sound design standing that sharply contrasts with its various flaws in editing, cinematography, and direction.\n\nAlthough there are some visually and emotionally stunning moments, they are frequently overshadowed by a lack of coherence and clarity.\n\nAlso, I think this film would be reasonable and great to be incorporated in a TV series which would have allowed for a more in-depth exploration of characters and plot.\n\nNevertheless, Madame Web is a bit of a mixed bag, with moments of potential that ultimately leave the viewer something different visually.\n\nRating: 3/10.'),(307,17,'2/10','How are bad writers able to continually get hired for big budget films?','syntory','15 February 2024','Look at the profiles for the writers that wrote Madame Web.

But this 80 million dollar film not just effects but production, feels obviously cheap, it almost feels like watching a very long pilot episode to a CW tv show.\n\nYou thought Morbius was bad, that film was bad because it did the bare minimum, this film doesn\'t even do the bare minimum, it goes beyond comprehension below that, it just enters a point of no originality or ambition towards creating anything.

This movie was more important to them than the superbowl LOL it\'s just so over the top & obviously placed way too much in this film. Calvin Klein, Chase bank, the list goes on. This movie should be called superhero product placement the movie.\n\nIt\'s barely even close to a 1/10 the cool moments are seeing what we already saw in the trailer when she\'s seeing the future & you think it\'s happening now but then it goes back to the moment she realizes it\'s a vision, granted it\'s cool the first couple times but it gets old REAL quick. & it ends up getting annoying because it\'s abused way too much.\n\nThats about it, there isn\'t any redeeming things in this film, the acting isn\'t even good. I would say the 3 side character spider women that Dakota finds when they are together there was a potential spark. I saw the talent & potential, but they are failed big time by such a horrid script that the spark never even sparks, it\'s just like showing you the matches & gasoline & not setting the fire.\n\nMadame M0RBIUS / 10.'),(314,17,'3/10','A massive waste of time','ethanbresnett','21 February 2024','Based on Madame Web\'s woeful reviews I was expecting this film to be an utter car crash. To its credit I will say it isn\'t entirely without merit, but it is incredibly boring and bland.\n\nMostly this is because nothing particularly happens. It\'s a superhero movie with little to no superhero action and a painfully long set up for an underwhelming final act. The characters are so underdeveloped that there is no emotional connection or investment in any of them. Everything about the story and writing just feels lazy, vacuous and corny.\n\nThen there\'s the villain who is utterly uninspiring. He is constantly complaining about \'everything he has built\' being destroyed. What has he built you might ask? The film has no interest in exploring this question. He\'s easily one of the more two dimensional and weak superhero villains I\'ve ever seen committed to screen.\n\nPerhaps the most heinous crime this movie commits is to waste the talents of Dakota Johnson, Sydney Sweeney, Adam Scott, Emma Roberts, Zosia Mamet and more. Such a good cast was assembled and they were given absolutely nothing to work with, so I don\'t blame the performers. It\'s just such a shame to see such great talent put to the sword like this.\n\nAs if all of this wasn\'t enough, the movie also feels remarkably low budget and feels excruciatingly long despite its relatively short runtime.\n\nUltimately I think this film suffered because it was clearly intended as a set up for a wider Spider-Woman franchise which is unlikely to come to fruition. There seemed to be no interest in making a good stand alone movie, and no respect for the audience. A massive waste of time.'),(315,17,'2/10','Badly made, weird film','vfphvnpp','14 February 2024','I understand what the plan was here.

The dialogue was awful, and there was quite a lot of blatant voice over during the villain scenes.\n\nSo much wasted time was given to boring scenes in the movie, which led me to believe the screen writers finished the script and realised that it was under the word count.\n\nHonestly the acting quality was quite poor across the board, especially the villain, who honestly seems as if they didn\'t cast for his role at all, just picked up someone off the side of the road.\n\nFor someone who\'s guilty pleasure is watching bad movies, I it was a painful time. Don\'t recommend.'),(316,17,'7/10','Is it always bad if it\'s not part of the MCU?','omed69','21 March 2024','\"Madame Web\" offers a refreshing departure from the typical MCU formula, inviting audiences to immerse themselves in the world of one of Marvel\'s lesser-known heroes. Detaching oneself from the expectation of a seamless integration into the broader MCU narrative allows for a more enjoyable viewing experience. While it may not reach the heights of some of its counterparts, the film still manages to deliver an entertaining ride, filled with enough thrills and excitement to keep audiences engaged. At its core, cinema is about escapism, and \"Madame Web\" certainly accomplishes that goal, providing viewers with a welcome respite from reality for its runtime. Criticisms of the film seem misplaced when compared to the mindless entertainment found in other media forms like reality TV. In the end, \"Madame Web\" deserves credit for its efforts to bring a lesser-known character to the forefront and provide audiences with a dose of enjoyable escapism. So, before casting judgment, perhaps it\'s worth considering the simple pleasure of having fun at the movies, regardless of whether it meets every critic\'s lofty expectations. So chill out haters.

You decide','Skruffbagg','20 February 2024','Cannon, is that you in disguise?\n\nI firmly believe Madame Web will go down in history as not only the worst superhero movie, but also one of the worst movies ever made. It\'s that bad. It\'s absolutely fascinating to behold.\n\nNow, I\'ll be honest with you here. I only went to see this because I had heard it was an unmitigated disaster that had to be seen to be believed, and it truly does not disappoint - or massively does, depending on your viewpoint.\n\nIt takes a special kind of director to get such cringe-inducing performances out of a fairly talented cast (Dakota Johnson and Tahar Rahim are both quality actors with the right script and direction), but SJ Clarkson somehow manages to wrangle the absolute worst imaginable from every single person in the film. I\'ll be very surprised if she ever does another feature after this.\n\nNothing in this film works; the plot is moronic, the script seems like it was written by a teenager, the cinematography is horrendous, the aformentioned embarrassing performances, the audio editing is baffling (so much dubbing, brain-melting music choices). I\'m amazed this didn\'t get shelved the minute the final cut was done.\n\nTo me, I rate this as \"so bad it\'s good\" as I wasn\'t bored watching it, but most people I assume will say it\'s just plain bad... and it is, but very entertainingly so.\n\nIf you love watching a 2hr car crash then I highly recommend this. The awfulness is mind-boggling in it\'s complexity, but in the best possible way. Film scholars and historians will be analysing this movie for years to come, and I hope it is talked about in the same vein as The Room in the future.\n\nAn absolutely epic misfire on all levels.'),(318,17,'8/10','In what crazy universe is this \"the worst movie of all time\"??','fung0','17 March 2024','There\'s some sort of madness that sweeps over movie critics and movie fans every so often. Some pundit, reviewer, influencer or other nitwit sounds off about how feeble, terrible, horribly BAD a movie is (or is *going* to be - these opinions often predate any viewing of the actual movie). And then the herd instinct takes over and generates a tsunami of contempt.\n\nCase in point, Madame Web - a truly ridiculous number of one-star reviews, completely unjustified by the actual experience of watching the movie.\n\nThe surprising truth is that this is actually quite a decent little movie. It\'s no work of genius, but it is a workmanlike, efficient, competent piece of entertainment. Not only is it not \"the worst,\" it is far more entertaining than a whole host of bloated, forgettable superhero flicks of the past few years.\n\nStart with the characters. We have an interesting heroine, Cassandra Webb, nicely embodied by Dakota Johnson. She\'s likeable, believable and suitably challenged by events she doesn\'t really understand. I can\'t speak to Johnson\'s acting range, not having seen her in anything else, but she seems to fit this particular part perfectly.\n\nMost of the movie has to do with Cassandra\'s attempts to protect three teen-age girls. All three of them are presented as distinct personalities, and are elevated beyond mere stereotypes by earnest and appealing performances by the trio of actresses. I not only believed them, I was happy to spend time with them.\n\nThen there\'s the story. It\'s nothing we haven\'t seen before, but it\'s done well. The origin of Cassandra\'s odd powers is novel, and revealed in stages that keep us guessing. Refreshingly, Cassandra needs to hold a super-villain at bay without actually knowing there\'s such a thing as a super-hero movie - or that she\'s in one.\n\nBetter yet, Cassandra\'s super-talent is inherently unpredictable, in an interesting way. It reminded me of the excellent Nicolas Cage film Next, in which he has the ability to see the future - two minutes at a time. The storyline of Madame Web is somewhat formulaic, to be sure - but it\'s a good formula, and well-executed. I never felt my intelligence was being insulted, and I certainly never felt bored.\n\nThe inevitable computer effects are used sparingly. Action is kept on a human scale - far more engrossing than watching CG heroes destroying planets with their pinky fingers.\n\nI tip-toed into Madame Web with dire forebodings of a wasted evening. Two hours later I found myself wishing the movie was longer - and wondering what ghastly childhood traumas must have prompted the vast torrents of vitriol that have been aimed at it.\n\nSure, Madame Web isn\'t a breakthrough of any kind. But it\'s a completely professional piece of work - a solid two hours\' escape from the troubles of the real world. Maybe it doesn\'t follow the comics - I don\'t know, and couldn\'t possibly care less. Maybe there were some nasty studio conflicts during production - again, not my concern. The end result was good. I had fun. Unless you come in solidly determined to hate, I can\'t see why you wouldn\'t have fun too.\n\nRating: 8 out of 10. To me, 7 indicates a movie that succeeds in its aims - that entertains and does nothing conspicuously off-putting, worth seeing for anyone who likes the genre. However, I felt compelled to add an extra mercy star to offset the numerous undeservedly low ratings.'),(319,17,'6/10','It wasn\'t that bad','angulolawoffice','16 May 2024','Hobbs & shaw, 3 of fast and furious movies, the last jedi and morbius are just a few movies that I can name that are worse than this movie.

It\'s not a great movie by any means, but it made sense and was entertaining.\n\nDakota Johnson is not a good actress in any movie, so she\'s always miscast. I can think of many actresses that could have played her role. She was a little distracting, as she always is. Had a better actress been hired, it would have made the movie better.\n\nThe three \"teens\" were not given enough lines, but they all acted as \"typical teens\".\n\nI do wish more background on Ezekiel were given.

I have read the novel long ago, but I\'m mostly familiar with the Dune universe from the Command & Conquer game Emperor: Battle for Dune. It\'s a vast universe with politics, religion, tribes and houses. The movie does an excellent job of placing you in this grand setting without over-explaining everything, but also without feeling completely lost. For someone new to the Dune universe you can easily recognize who the \"good\" and \"bad\" guys are and follow the plot, without knowing who all the different names refer to.

And perhaps as a fan of the book my expectations were too high. Dune had the potential to be one of the great films of recent times. The material - if difficult to adapt - is there. Themes that, despite the book\'s publication date of 1965, seem ever so relevant today: natural resource exploitation to the detriment of the environment; drug addiction and its geo-political consequences; rebellion against colonial occupation; the power of religion as a political tool; a cautionary perspective on the western hero journey. This story could have hit a serious chord with today\'s audiences. Alas, Villeneuve\'s film depicts the plot of Dune, but fails to tell its story. It marches through the plot points, bringing them to life with impressive visual style, but fails to hone in on the themes above. We\'re left with a solid sci-fi adventure that really could have been so much more.\n\nIt\'s possible Villeneuve was not the right director for this adaptation, despite his professed love for the book. He is no doubt an accomplished director with a strong track record, but I always suspected he was more of a technical maestro than an emotive storyteller, and Dune seems to confirm that. In the end, there is a shortage of scenes that are memorable on an emotional level. Furthermore, there is a serious lost opportunity to inject suspense into the first act of the film, instead turning it into a plodding exercise in exposition. Thus the feeling of fatalism that pervades the book is nowhere to be found. Character moments which would have required no additional screen time, such as Gurney\'s penchant for singing, are lost, and the character development suffers as a result. Equally confounding is the lack of focus on the spice, which really should have been a \"character\" in its own right.\n\nMy other major gripe is with the score and pacing, which feed off one another. Pounding, rhythmic scores like Hans Zimmer\'s seem to be all the rage these days, but am I passé for wanting a melodic refrain that emotionally reinforces the climactic moments? Once it gets going, Zimmer\'s score never lets up and never gives the audience a chance to catch their breath. The pacing gets stuck in one speed with no time to dwell on the important moments, a surprising blunder for a director you would expect to know the value of varying pitch and tone. To be fair, Dune is not an easy book to adapt, and properly telling this tale probably required more runtime than the studio was willing to stomach. However, I still would have expected Villeneuve\'s passion for the material to run a bit deeper than surface level.\n\n--\n\nYou can get more reviews from me at my substack Haremonious Sounds.'),(337,19,'6/10','Cool but boring','stefancandyman','14 November 2021','If you haven\'t read the book or seen the old movie this is gonna be super confusing and as such also boring to you.

Have read all the books multiple times and of course I\'ve seen Lynch\'s version. This version is a lot better. Excellent world building, visually stunning and full of star power. It moves slow, which on the plus side gives it the chance to go into detail, but on the negative side means by the end it\'s not even at the halfway point of the first book. So it ends at the moment the mythology is just picking up. Which made me leave the cinema wishing to see part two, which unfortunately they haven\'t even started filming.\n\nSo IMHO the reviews giving this movie a 10 or calling it the movie of the year are overly positive. It\'s a visually stunning start to a potentially mind blowing universe, but mainly an introduction to that universe. Maybe when the story is finished (wouldn\'t surprise me if they need three movies for the first book) it will be mind blowing and perfect, but for now this movie is a great introduction to the duneverse. Good, but not great. Yet.\n116 out of 146 found this helpful. Was this review helpful?

While he had already proven himself in handling delicate material with Blade Runner 2049, I think Dune strikes an even better balance, partly due to the phenomenal source material, which however poses more challenging tasks to the writers and director due to the inherent political backdrop of the storyline.\n\nEven the stellar cast, which are all very recognizable faces and could take away from the world building of the movie deliver excellent performances, and Timothee Chalamet (of whom I am not always the biggest fan) seems born to play the role of Paul Atreides.\n\nDO NOT listen to predominantly American professional reviewers who accuse the movie to be a slow burner and a slog towards the end: in the last few years the \"Marvel pocorn\" movies have dominated the big budget landscape and the reviewers are just not used to immersing themselves anymore in an actual story.'),(343,19,'6/10','The long awaited Dune resurrection','klimentp','17 December 2021','What a visually stunning film.

It is stunningly beautiful to look at. The cinematography is compelling and deserves to be seen on the big screen. The cast. Some the best actors working today. Stellan Skarsgard\'s Baron Harkonen channels Brando\'s Colonel Kurtz quite well. Special effects. Top notch. Music, properly grandiose.\n\nYou know what can\'t be said about DUNE PART 1?\n\nThat it\'s any fun. Or that it\'s entertaining.\n\nTimothy Chalemet has zero charisma and zero chemistry with Zendaya. I still don\'t get why he\'s such a big star at the moment. Maybe it\'s just me...\n\nSome don\'t recall David Lynch\'s 1984 version with the fondness it deserves. And while a bit jumbled at times. Somewhat hard to understand at others. During its original theatrical run a glossary page was handed to movie goers before each screening. (Wish o had one of those!)\n\nBut it was tight. It was weird and wonderful in a way that the new version fails to be. Lynch took roughly the same amount of time to give us an adaptation of the whole novel. And it was an entertaining and engrossing cinematic ride.\n\nBy stretching the source material to two films, it creates boredom where there should be excitement. Scenes go on and on, when they clearly don\'t need to. I found myself expecting the credits to roll for the last twenty-five minutes or so of Villeneuve\'s film.

The visual of the film is amazing. The attention to detail and the realism of the world portrayed on screen is impressive. I was more than once impressed and gripped to my seat in front of some visuals (especially those related to the sandworm). The special effects, the way of filming and the precision on some details allow a total immersion in the world of Dune. You could almost touch the quicksand with your fingers.\n\nThe sandworm is definitely the best visual thing I\'ve seen. The realism of the sand waves created by the worm is astounding and gives a real sense of danger and wonder. In fact, the film creates the necessary tension around this creature. I had never been especially terrified or fascinated by the worm before seeing this movie.\n\nI also particularly liked the richness of the Fremen universe that this film shows. The different equipments used to survive in the desert make it possible to understand the hostility of the environment as well as why the Fremen are dangerous and particular because they have managed to adapt and live with the desert not just in terms of climate but in term equipments. These are the kind of details that enrich the universe.\n\nSound: Sound does not have the musical function it often has in films. It is a real prop to immerse the viewer in the universe, underlining an action, a noise and the like. The rumblings, tremors, pulses felt make the world of Dune alive, captivating and make it a real 4DX experience in a normal theater.\n\nStory: The story of the film is very well constructed. The director takes the time to set the scene, introduce the universe and put the characters in their comfort zone before launching the plot. This time given to the exposure of the world and the characters allows the audience to understand the issues at hand, to know the different relationships and what is going on in the minds of the characters (mainly the character of Paul).\n\nThe film builds a palpable but subtle tension throughout its first arc which leads us to the mid-film climax. The pace doesn\'t slow down after that. The film subtly and dynamically alternates action scenes with more poised ones. The action is present and well paced without being omnipresent and does not suffocate the audience with endless sequences without emotions. The film is understandable for everyone. It takes the time to present the different political factions and the issues while maintaining a little mystery about some political actors.\n\nThe ending, although very open, fit with the story told in this first part and gives a feeling of accomplishment of a quest while making the audience understand that nothing is finished, far from there.\n\nCharacters: All characters serve their purpose. The ones that revolve around the Atreides are specially well written. Each has their own personality, function and relationship to other characters. The acting combined with the writing allows the audience to become attached to these various characters, to understand them, to have empathy for them and to fear for their lives.\n\nThe main character, Paul Atreides, is written with a lot of subtlety, complexity and emotion. Everything is done, including the acting, so that the audience understands and sympathizes with this affectionate teenager, still immature and lacking in self-confidence, who is aware he must grow up and try to live up to his position as heir to a Duke. This complicated period between childhood and adulthood is well portrayed on screen. To this gradually comes to add an understanding of his difference. And the audience feels a great pity to see him progressively become someone he doesn\'t want to be and be thrown into a path he doesn\'t want to take.\n\nLady Jessica, the film\'s second leading role, embodies with great charisma and subtlety the mysterious aura of her order. Alternately self-confident, emotional, stoic and badass, she is a complex character that is still a little mysterious but terribly human and understandable. The mother and son bond is also well exploited on the screen.\n\nThe Harkonnen are not caricatured but frightening and cruel.\n\nConclusion: Dune by Denis Villeneuve is a very good film, even an excellent film. It is rare to succeed in combining visual, sound and storyline without it being to the detriment of one of these elements. It\'s also complicated to make an adaptation of a book that satisfies both readers and non-readers. And this bet was successful. Non-readers will not understand everything at 100%, but the film gives them enough to understand most of what it says. The rest can remain a mystery, understandable after a second viewing or when Part 2 airs.\n\nAfter all, when the first Star Wars came out, not everyone understood what the Jedi, the Force, the Emperor and the like were, but that didn\'t stop us from enjoying the adventure. Here, since the film is intended to be more political and immersive, the audience has a lot more information and explanations.\n\nDune is a real sci-fi rodeo. It is a science fiction movie, a Greek tragedy, an art\'s movie and a blockbuster. This is an immersive and psychological experience that will not leave the audience untouched.'),(350,19,'10/10','Breathtaking movie!','full-inbox','7 October 2021','It\'s been years since I\'ve seen anything like this.

His partner is the also honest, efficient and wealthy Detective Mike Lowrey (Will Smith), who inherits a large amount from his family and although living like a playboy, has not resigned to his position in the police department. After a daring robbery of heroin from the police department stores, the two detectives try to find some clue about the gang. The chance appears with the hooker Julie Mott (Téa Leoni), the witness of the murder of a \'working girl\' friend of her. The detectives are assigned to protect her and chase the killers. Although full of clichés, \'Bad Boys\' is an excellent action movie, in the same line of \'Lethal Weapon\'. There are lots of funny parts, Martin Lawrence and Will Smith are excellent as the two partners with different behaviors and Téa Leoni is gorgeous.

It\'s a fairly easy genre to master, and an easy way to make a good movie. This is one of the best examples, since Smith and Lawrence really do compliment each other so well; Smith\'s the sleek, cool one who is popular with the ladies, while Lawrence is often nervous, and pretty much a direct opposite of Smith. They have pretty good on-screen chemistry, too; you believe that these are good friends and partners. My only real problem with the film is the way the comedy almost all is generated by stereotypes, and, worse, the age-old complications that arise from certain situations. I think that\'s a little unoriginal, but, hey, that\'s the only complaint about it, and the film does have some very entertaining comedy parts. The plot is pretty good, it keeps the film going and supplies every single scene with comedy, action, or both. It takes off immediately, and keeps a good pace throughout the 2 hour duration. The acting is all pretty good. The characters are well-written, well, for stereotypes at least(because, lets face it; they are). The comedy is well-done and often made me laugh out loud, and, believe me, I am not, in any way, shape or form, a Will Smith fan. The action was well-done too, intense and exciting. The film, all in all, was pretty good, very entertaining. For a buddy comedy, it\'s good. For an action comedy, it\'s good too.

I like Will Smith, I like Martin Lawrence, so I figured this film will at least be funny. And it was funny, and then some. It was action packed, thrilling and a helluva good time. I came out of the theatre thinking that the guy who directed that movie is going to be huge.\n\nMichael Bay, former music video and commercial director, has made an incredible directorial debut. The film never stops. When it isn\'t action-packed, it is funny. It is sexy, fun and always moving. Christian Wagner\'s editing is phenomenal. I love action movies that really try to be action movies. A lot of action films know that they are action films so they try to incorporate other genres to make the film more complete, but they often fail miserably. They try so hard to be something they are not that they forget what they are in the first place. The essence of the action film is the action. It is a necessary component, it needs to be there otherwise it loses its edge. \"Bad Boys\" doesn\'t just throw in the occassional action sequence to meet the expectations of the genre, but instead uses the action to help tell the story. It is this use of filmmaking that allows an action film to remain an action film and still go beyond.\n\nWatch \"Bad Boys\" again and every time there is an action sequence, ask yourself why that was there and what did it accomplish. You will find that each sequence took the film to another level; it introduced an new conflict, it increased the present conflict, it eliminated a key character, it introduced a new character, and so on. There are a lot of action films out there that sacrifice story for spectacle, and the audience notices this. At the centre of all films lies the story and if it comes to a halt so does the interest of the viewers.\n\n\"Bad Boys\" of course isn\'t the greatest story on film, or even in the action genre, but what is so appealing and memorable about \"Bad Boys\" is that it is just as entertaining with its story as it is with its action by combining the two without sacrificing either. Michael Bay understands the importance of the story within the structure of the film. He tells a visual story, entertaining and complete, and leaves you very satisfied.

It owes practically all of its success to its two stars, with Lawrence and Smith\'s constant banter being pretty much the only interesting thing in the entire affair. I mean, it\'s not like the movie is boring or anything. It\'s just very by the numbers and isn\'t all that compelling. It\'s entertaining enough, I suppose, for a bit of brainless fun, and I will admit that it has one or two genuine laughs. Most of it is just pure nonsense, though. The plot, for instance, is all over the place. It\'s almost impossible to follow, in a sense, because it just sort of happens. At the same time, it isn\'t all that important. The flick\'s focus is certainly on the odd \'in disguise as each other\' dynamic that keeps its charismatic leads on their toes. Their relationship is a decent amount of fun, but it\'s a bit frustrating because it never really evolves (and barely has any consequences). Still, it gives the movie an undeniable charm. Ultimately, the picture is relatively enjoyable when it\'s underway. It\'s quite forgettable, though, and it isn\'t exactly a genre defining experience. 6/10.'),(356,20,'6/10','A funny, thoroughly entertaining action comedy','LG72387','7 August 2003','Bad Boys is a great action comedy from producers Don Simpson and Jerry Bruckheimer. It features Will Smith (in his breakout performance) and Martin Lawrence, an unlikely pair who quite simply are the best movie duo I\'ve seen since Jackie Chan and Chris Tucker in Rush Hour. The film features incredible action sequences (i.e. the Ether truck chase scene featuring massive explosions and pervasive gun fights) which all lead up to the film\'s action-packed climax which could only be done in a Jerry Bruckheimer film. The film also stars Tea Leoni (who is pretty good in playing the damsel in distress), Joe Pantoliano (whom we all know as Ralphie on The Sopranos, as a police captain) and Tcheky Karyo as the villain. (He was also the French officer opposite Mel Gibson in 2000\'s The Patriot) The movie features comedic one-liners from Smith and Lawrence as well as a few by Leoni. It also features a few sex jokes and just plain \"disses\". However, the characters are so underdeveloped that all we are left with is action and comedy. This formula is also seen in the recent summer blockbuster Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines, in which we could care less about the characters and just look for the action. However, Simpson and Bruckheimer\'s Bad Boys succeeds where T3 does not. By the end of the movie, we care about the heroes because they are fun to watch. In T3, the great Ah-nuld is just a figurehead for a movie romped with action-packed sequences and jaw-dropping stunts.

This is a film that I really do believe that it is a classic action movie of the 90\'s. This is my childhood movie my all time classic action buddy cop films honestly? I think it is MILES way better action movie than Lethal Weapon and Beverly Hills Cop, but that is just me and my opinion. I love this film to death it is my all time favorite Michael Bay film along with The Rock (1996), Transformers and Transformers: Dark of the Moon. I saw this movie probably over 10.0000 times more than the sequel, my mom bought me a VHS tape which I still have it. I bought this movie on Blu-Ray years ago and no I don\'t have (Mastered in 4K) I have a normal Blu-ray disc. The only thing that bothers me is a green cover which does not fit to this film. This is my all time favorite Will Smith movie I grew up watching his TV show The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air (1990 - 1996) and Bad Boys become my favorite Will Smith film along side Bad Boys II and Independence Day, these are my all time favorite Will Smith movies that he did. Someday I am going to re watch Men In Black trilogy.\n\nPlot: Will Smith and Martin Lawrence are Miami Police Department detectives who find themselves protecting a murder witness while investigating a case of stolen heroin from a dangerous drug lord.\n\nThe basically plot for this movie is about a 100 million dollars Heroin is stolen from the police headquarters. Two police officers have 72 hours to reclaim the heroin before the Internal Affairs Division gets involved and close their department forever and everyone on the force will lose their job. Their is a lot on stake and only one witness is ready to identify a drug dealer in return to get a justice for her murdered best friend.\n\nWhy I love this film: This movie has practical everything has ton\'s of action, great dialogues, a few comedy scenes and a great babes including great theme scores by Mark Mancina. The chemistry between the lead is well written and I love the story off the two unlikely heroes who protect innocent people. It\'s filled with non-stop action. Michael Bay did a great job, it has awesome action with gory gun fights, fast car chases, massive explosions, but is still funny with Will and Martin.\n\nThis is a prototypical \"good\" action movie -- intense, perfectly executed, original action, shown to the tune of a forgettable and occasionally insulting story.\n\nThe final shoot-out in the airport hanger is one of my favorite action scenes from Michael Bay and it\'s all beautifully shot.\n\nTéa Leoni is hot, gorgeous and sexy as Julie Mott a murder witness she is so charming and beautiful heart in this movie.\n\nThis film is dark and sometimes is really scary when the moment like Will Smith is attacked in pimp\'s dark house and thrown out of the window.\n\nMark Mancina gives his second best score (after Speed) which also is very similar in tone. You can tell it\'s from the same guy. It\'s got a great theme tune, screeching electric guitars and some funky hip hop beats too.\n\nTchéky Karyo almost steals the movie as the villain Fouchet; he just oozes menace and when he\'s on screen there is a constant threat of impending violence. Tchéky played another bad guy villain in Jet Li\'s Kiss of the Dragon (2001), so i saw him twice as a bad guy.\n\nThe heroes in this movie are two Police Officers Marcus Burnett (Martin Lawrence) and Mike Lowrey (Will Smith) who are well written and they are very likable. My favorite character is Mike Lowrey. I love the switch identities that was really hilarious and funny, I laughed my ass off on Martin\'s character.\n\nThere\'s no shaky cam or CGI here but real explosions, Hard-R fight scenes and some nice one-liners.\n\nI love Bad Boys song on the end of the title credits performed by Inner Circle.\n\nOf course, this wouldn\'t be an action movie without some action. There\'s plenty of it, and it\'s perfectly done. The gunplay in this movie is delivered in a perfect Bay-Lawrence-Smith style (as opposed to the slo-mo John Woo-style) -- you\'ll see a lot of hand guns and heavy automatic weapons, and you\'ll see them used well. Hard explosions and an awesome bad ass car chase on the end of the movie! The film is violent, and bloody, but ALL of the mean-spirited violence is dealt by the evil characters, not the ones you root for (Quentin Tarantino fans: sorry). And then the truly amazing scenes that bypass acting are shocking and memorable -- just wait for the bad guy (Tchéky Karyo) been shoot to death by Will Smith on the end sequence.\n\nSplitting the difference, I am giving an 10/10 -- an outstanding score.\n\nBad Boys is a 1995 American buddy cop action-comedy film directed by Michael Bay, produced by Don Simpson and Jerry Bruckheimer and starring Martin Lawrence and Will Smith as two narcotic Miami detectives Marcus Burnett and Mike Lowrey.

The movie follows Miami detectives Mike Lowrey (Smith) and Marcus Burnett (Lawrence) as they work to recover a stolen cache of heroin while protecting a key witness.\n\nSmith and Lawrence\'s chemistry is the film\'s strongest asset, with their witty banter and contrasting personalities providing much of the film\'s humor. The action sequences, typical of Bay\'s directorial style, are fast-paced and explosive, keeping the audience engaged throughout.\n\nHowever, while the film is entertaining, it is not without its flaws. The plot is fairly predictable and follows a formulaic structure common to many action comedies of its time. Additionally, some of the humor and character dynamics feel dated by modern standards.\n\nDespite these shortcomings, \"Bad Boys\" delivers a fun and thrilling ride. Its blend of comedy, action, and star power makes it an enjoyable watch, particularly for fans of the genre. While not groundbreaking, it sets the stage for the successful franchise that follows.'),(363,20,'3/10','boring standard movie','Aemstel','18 September 2000','There must be a million movies like this.

The score establish Michael Bay as more than a music video director, it proved black leads could spew on the fence jokes about society and still deliver at the box office and most importantly, in my opinion, catapult Will Smith into the realm of being a superstar.\n\nIn all senses of the word the movie is a Hollywood classic, with grown folks alone present it would be the perfect movie to play at a family gathering. It has action, a love interest and laughs to go around at every turn. The chemistry between Martin and Will makes this movie stand out among Hollywood\'s well established duo action films. Always compared to that of Rush Hour.\n\nIn terms of acting there were no horrendous performances, however, Will\'s portrayal of his character was not completely believable. At times it seemed a bit forced, as if attempting to be this hard stone playboy, then again it was his introduction to the big stage and with that perspective in mind, he did really well in regards to his prior experience.\n\nThe only issue with this film for me was the film editing it did not feel cohesive enough, certain shots felt out of place and therefore made the quality of the film seem cheap. It is my belief this and a few other political ambitions and perspectives at that time in the 90\'s prevented it from being critically acclaimed.\n\nThe crazy thing is that for me, aside from the comedy, the music and sound mixing was my favourite part of the movie. Partially biased to my Jamaican culture perhaps but the sound track and the sound editing on this film was phenomenal, then again Bay had done plenty music videos before he tried his hand in film so there is that.\n\nI also forgot to mention Martin did really well in his roll, his character protryal was believable in the sense that he really embodied that role.\n\nWith all of this in mind I believe this film warrants a 6/10. Thank you for your time and I hope Bay\'s films continue to garner success.'),(367,20,'6/10','When you\'re in a small box, whatcha gonna do?','StevePulaski','6 May 2012','Michael Bay\'s Bad Boys, his first feature film, is probably his best. But that sure isn\'t saying much. He has always favored the route of bloated and stupid rather than coherent and intelligent, and he is anything but subtle in his first feature attempt as a director. Consistent readers of my work know I have an incredible disdain for the director/writer himself, but I in no way believe he is a bad, horrible person. I\'m just saying he writes, more often than not, bad, horrible films. I have no doubt in my mind that he is capable of writing and directing a good film, but he gets too involved with things that should be the secondary elements in a film. He brings background elements firmly into the foreground, and that poses a big problem.\n\nThe story centers around Marcus Burnett (Lawrence) and Mike Lowrey (Smith), two detectives for the Miami-Dade Police Department, who are called in to hunt down a $100 million worth of heroin that was intricately stolen from a secure vault. One of the petty criminals is Fouchet (Karyo), who early in the film shoots one of two escorts in his mansion. The other one named Julie (Leoni) will only speak to Lowrey on the count of her friends\' relationship with the man.\n\nWhen Julie calls in about the murder, Lowrey is away, and the Captain forces Burnett to pose as Lowrey so as not to lose a valuable witness. He accepts, and off on a tangent we go through what is soon to be the long, eventful odyssey of mistaken identity. While Burnett puts Julie under protective custody, both the men work in seclusion to try and capture the drug lords and get their stash back.\n\nWhile not wonderfully executed, I can at least say that Bad Boys is fun and provides lightweight entertainment for those seeking it. It isn\'t the finest example of goofy, popcorn entertainment that I have encountered, but I can recognize the film has an audience that will be satisfied with the turnout, much like those horrifically awful Transformers films Bay so contently puts out. Just because I can respect that there is a fanbase for his material, doesn\'t mean I am forced to sit back and like it, and that\'s why I choose to voice my opinion on a lot of his films.\n\nLawrence and Smith do a great job working together, both having expressive personalities and cheery, electric chemistry that provides kinetic energy to the screenplay. Although it appears as if their roles were switched. I have a hard time believing that Lawrence\'s Burnett is the mostly straight-laced cop with a family, and Smith\'s Lowrey is the fearless player with an act for taking advantage of women by having a different one every night. During the course of the film, I couldn\'t help but feel it should be the other way around. If that\'s a bit too vague to try and grasp, let me try and put it this way; has Will Smith ever been given a lesser role in any of his recent filmography? I too discovered that the original title for Bad Boys was going to be \"Bulletproof Hearts\" with SNL buds Dana Carvey and Jon Lovitz taking the roles of Lawrence and Smith. While I would\'ve adored a buddy-cop comedy with Carvey and Lovitz as the leads, I couldn\'t quite grasp the idea of two cleaned-up guys like them playing dirty cops. For better or for worse, the roles were given to the right people.\n\nWhile the film provides light escapism, Bad Boys, however, makes one near-crucial mistake; it is too heavy-handed and over-produced to classify as campiness, which is what it is seemingly trying to achieve. It\'s a tad too long, shot like a music video (what else do you expect from Bay, who started out in that field?), and is viable because of its leads who have a charming chemistry and their commitment to a project so quirky and arbitrary. But, really, when you\'re working on a glossy piece of Hollywood, brought to you by someone whose talent is in the visual effects field and not much else, and are sometimes trudging through muddy clichés, whatcha gonna do? Starring: Martin Lawrence, Will Smith, Téa Leoni, and Tchéky Karyo.

A blockbuster - no expense spared. Lowry and Burnett (Will Smith and Martin Lawrence) are Miami PD and working on a drug bust heist from within the PD itself. It\'s a big film, even on a small screen you get the impression of scale, and everything is impressive. You are treated to slow motion shots accentuating our heroes in grand cinematography-style, long chases with Will Smith\'s shirt wide open, model-esque women everywhere, and everything is just glamorous. Tea Leoni is the \"love interest\" but in a messed up sort of way because she\'s in the middle of a subterfuge and Lowry and Burnett have switched roles... she witnessed her best friend get shot and is now the target, and Lowry is looking after her, except it\'s Burnett and his wife is MAD. It\'s typical action-adventure stuff; huge scenes, car chases, big stunts, car chases, explosions, wanton disregard of realistic police procedure, respect for human life or property and thinking nothing of blowing up a motorway etc ... very similar in feel to Speed, which incidentally has a very similar theme tune to Bad Boys (along with The Rock), and all three are exciting and ramp up the feeling of action. There\'s a lot of comedy - between Smith and Lawrence, in their fast talking brash way, then there\'s the sarcastic humour of their boss Joe Pantoliano (Matrix) in similar fashion to John C McGinley in Point Break, then there\'s the situational comedy of things being silly and going wrong and you really get the connection between Smith and Lawrence as actors - they play it well. There is a really good chemistry between them, and it\'s quite a bromance movie as well as action (I have no idea whether the two are friends in real life but their relationship is believable on screen). The plot is of course the least of importance in this film and is rather flimsy, but films like this are about visuals and Bad Boys is a great watch that you can watch again and again. It hasn\'t aged too badly - except in terms of technology (pagers and large in car phones) - and Will Smith is always a joy to watch. Tea Leoni is very good, and oddly believable in her role and her chemistry with the two actors was fun. It\'s a sexy film; Smith just is as he is so assured of himself, but also the chemistry between Leoni and Smith, although it\'s not at the forefront of the plot. It\'s clichéd left right and centre, of course, nothing original, or particularly challenging but not mindless, and I wouldn\'t be giving out any Oscars but everything comes together to create something you want to go to the cinema to see. It\'s a very entertaining action film with the added and lightening aspect of comedy. Generally speaking action films like this are for the boys in the audience but there is most definitely plenty in it for the girls so a win win for everyone.'),(370,20,'9/10','Fantastic action setpieces','rivertam26','15 January 2020','This movies action scenes are ridiculous and utterly fantastic.

The pair of officers come upon a drug cartel and end up protecting a feisty witness played by a slightly annoying but kinda bad ass Tea Leoni. It\'s strange as the film almost comes across as a parody because it revels in such cliches and celebrates them. And honestly that\'s really part of its charm.

My only thing that was holding me back from seeing this film was Martin Lawerence. For the most part, he annoys me and it seems like he has the same part in every movie, but I have to admit, I could tolerate him during this film.\n\nMarcus and Mike are two partner cops on the force together, they have been friends for a long time, Marcus is a married family man and Mike is still living up his one night stands. The boys are assigned to a missing dope case that turns into murder and helping the only witness, Julie, survive. Marcus takes the role as playing Mike to make sure that his family is safe, but you can guess how this story is going to turn out from here.\n\nBad Boys was a pretty good buddy cop film, but it could have been funnier.

When an existential threat of true AI dominance arises, threatening human extinction, the protagonist bonds with an AI cohort, and fends off the uprising and destroys the AI central threat.\n\nThis movie really wanted to be that movie, except in space with a female lead. There is a real thing in Hollywood: you can steal a story if you change several key aesthetics. So, here we are.\n\nThere are a lot of other problems. The most visible of which is Lopez. She\'s the kind of actress who some time ago encountered the nadir that many actors do: her status as a celebrity eclipsed her stature as an actress, and she began performing in a very packaged and self conscious way. When you can tell an actor is thinking about how they look in a film, that\'s not good.\n\nThe other challenges? When a lead performer is as polarizing as Lopez there are many who will \"hate watch\" this, rubbing their hands together in anticipation of the imminent schadenfreude. And because the plot and dialogue is weak, they\'ll get their wish.\n\nIt\'s further complicated that the director, Peyton (Andreas), is familiar enough with spectacle, but not masterful in putting together something that should be of epic scale.\n\nAdd to those obstacles the glaringly apparent lack of originality in the script or character beats, and you have a patient that is Dead On Arrival.\n\nThe script attempts to make the story of AI galactic domination relatable by focusing on Atlas\'s (Lopez) personal history with betrayal. Unfortunately it throws the entire weight of impending genocide out of orbit. It makes the trials of the protagonist feel small; and Lopez, not looking dirty enough or scarred enough, hits every mark we see coming from a mile away.\n\nMark Strong, Simu Liu and other supporting cast members are saddled with similar story, plot and dialogue problems.\n\nWhat we get is another big splashy Netflix film that will be forgotten in a hurry; to be half-watched while doing chores or sitting on a plane.\n\nBummer.'),(385,21,'7/10','Not as bad as described','horstbegerak','25 May 2024','I had fun watching it.

Personally I don\'t mind at all. Cause I enjoy both genre equally. The story is pretty straightforward and there is no major plot twist. And I think anyone can guess the twist at the end of the movie. It\'s pretty obvious. But still, it\'s a great movie, no matter what J-Lo\'s haters said. You\'d be an idiot to miss this one.

My goal is to give every movie a fair shake, and to seek out the best elements even when a film disappoints. I don\'t recall a time when this goal has been more difficult to achieve than after watching this latest from director Brad Peyton (San Andreas, 2015) and co-writers Leo Sardarian (\"StartUp\"), Aron Eli Coleite (\"Locke & Key\").\n\nJennifer Lopez stars as Atlas Shepherd, a brilliant government analyst and expert on AI, especially on Harlan (Simu Liu, BARBIE), ominously deemed the world\'s first AI terrorist. We know Atlas is smart because she has a chess winning streak against the computer and she wears black frame eyeglasses. After an opening which features Earth in peril, we flash forward 28 years, where it\'s evolved into \"good AI\" versus \"evil AI\". Don\'t worry, Atlas is on the side of good, despite her constantly frazzled state (with perfect hair) and the personal (emotional) baggage she carries with her.\n\nAfter years of searching, Atlas discovers the location for Harlan, and General Boothe (Mark Strong, character actor extraordinaire) forms a team led by Colonel Elias Banks (Sterling K Brown, AMERICAN FICTION, 2023) to capture Harlan so his CPU can be studied. Of course, the mission doesn\'t go as planned and by the end, I was wondering which racked up the most points: explosions or Ms. Lopez\'s cringy acting moments. Terrible punchlines regarding a running coffee gag placed third in the competition. Since I admittedly search for positives in every movie, let\'s go with Simu Liu\'s unusual blue-eyed effect, the tight pants on Agent Atlas, and giant robotics that look like the one that went rogue in ROBOCOP (37 years ago). Apologies, but that\'s the best I can do for this one, other than to say we have an early Razzie frontrunner.\n\nOn Netflix beginning May 24, 2024.'),(390,21,'7/10','A Pulpy, fun Sci Fi yarn from San Andreas director with a committed performance from Jennifer Lopez.','ubikcorp','25 May 2024','I have no idea why some reviewers are panning Jennifer Lopez\' acting.

There have been some great ones like the two Extraction Movies with Chris Hemsworth, but there\'s also been a number of them that have been bombing critically with critics and audiences. It\'s gotten to the point where no one cares or even talks about them and Atlas (2024) is yet another prime example of that trend. With all that being said, it\'s time to talk about the movie.\n\nPositives for Atlas (2024): If you enjoy these Netflix Action Blockbusters, then you\'ll definitely enjoy this one. That\'s it for the positives.\n\nNegatives for Atlas (2024): First of all, the plot of this movie is one we\'ve seen done a billion times before and done better in other movies. Also, you have Jennifer Lopez as the main protagonist of the movie and all I have to say is Why? I don\'t have anything against J-Lo, but she just doesn\'t fit this role, you could literally replace her with any other actor or actress and you would still have the same movie. The storyline between her character and this A. I. is as boring and generic as you would expect. Also, the movie completely wastes Sterling K. Brown, Simu Liu and Mark Strong. There\'s a lot more I could talk about, but it\'s the same old stuff in other Netflix Action Blockbusters.\n\nOverall, this is a movie that everyone will forget about and they\'ll be moving on with their lives.

Set in a dystopian future where humanity\'s survival hinges on a delicate balance between technology and nature, the film crafts a world that is both hauntingly beautiful and starkly terrifying.\n\nThe movie\'s strongest asset is its visual storytelling. The art direction and cinematography work in tandem to create a universe that feels lived-in and plausible, yet alien enough to capture the imagination. The landscapes, both urban and rural, are meticulously detailed, and the use of color and light effectively conveys the contrasting themes of hope and despair.\n\nThe narrative, while occasionally dipping into familiar sci-fi tropes, is engaging and thought-provoking. It explores themes of identity, sacrifice, and the human condition with a deft touch, avoiding heavy-handedness. The plot twists are well-executed, keeping the audience on their toes without resorting to cheap gimmicks.\n\nPerformances are uniformly strong, with each actor bringing depth and nuance to their roles. The protagonist\'s journey is compelling, marked by moments of vulnerability and strength that feel genuine and earned. The supporting cast also delivers, providing memorable performances that enhance the film\'s emotional core.\n\nThe film\'s score deserves special mention. It underscores the action and drama without overpowering it, complementing the visual elements perfectly. The music enhances the narrative, adding layers of emotion and tension that elevate key scenes.\n\nHowever, Atlas is not without its flaws. The pacing, particularly in the second act, can feel uneven, with certain sequences dragging longer than necessary. Additionally, some of the secondary characters, while well-acted, lack the development needed to make their arcs fully satisfying.\n\nDespite these minor issues, Atlas stands out as a noteworthy entry in the science fiction genre. It balances spectacle with substance, offering a film that is as intellectually stimulating as it is visually captivating. For fans of thought-provoking cinema, Atlas is a journey worth taking.'),(393,21,'6/10','Decent sci-fi/fantasy, but could easily be much much better!','vitalymakievsky','25 May 2024','The movie starts out great. We have a cop who is frustrated with her life, she\'s an emotional mess, heavily addicted to coffee and falls a sleep on the couch regularly, living the bachelor\'s lifestyle. So your typical 80\'s and early 90s cop movie start but with a PG-13 rating.\n\nOur protagonist Atlas, is also a bit rash, hyper intelligent, she doesn\'t like to play by the rules, mistrusting, and is a bit to heavy handed. I really liked that this Hollywood trope and I\'ve never seen this type character given to a female lead. Made the old trope fresher.\n\nI hate to say this, but this movie is a missed opportunity for a great sci-fi move. But it is sort of broken into two peaces. On one side it\'s a real deal sci-fi, and on the other it\'s a pure action movie. And a lot of this action could have been cut out to explore more sciency stuffs.\n\nFor you who like a character driven plot, you might like this movie. Our protagonist is forced to go on an extremely dangerous mission, and in order to save her life and accomplish her life\'s mission, she has to learn to trust an AI robot, and grow as a person.\n\nThere are some serious issues in this movie, on how technology works, based on the information the audience is given, and a few highly derivative scenes designed to keep the character narrative progressing forward...but it is a movie, and not a book.\n\nI looked at a few reviews, and I was very surprised at the hate on Jenifer Lopez. I have never been into pop culture and didn\'t realize who the lead was until I looked at the IMBD actors list. I personally think she did a great job, looked great with the new hairstyle, and playing a different character. She is very likable. So, my point is I have no idea why she is despised by so many reviewers...? Perhaps, she made some insensitive comments in the pop literature? I just don\'t know.\n\nOverall, this could have been a very serious sci-fi movie, but the direction opted for an action movie instead.

Do remakes suck? Usually. But this is a solid action flick that doesn\'t hide what it is: a slapstick action flick packed with ridiculous amounts of alpha Chad characters and protagonist plot armor. It\'s laid on pretty thick throughout the film that it\'s meant to be a goofy punchfest of senseless violence and overly eccentric characters.\n\nEven if you haven\'t seen the original, this film still stand out on its own as a movie that\'s just fun to watch and at no point takes itself seriously. If you\'re looking for a deep and thought provoking storyline, then this might not for you. But if you enjoy the adrenaline junkie style akin to John Wick or just about anything Jason Statham, then it\'s highly recommended.\n\nThe most impressive thing that stands out in this film is Jake G\'s commendable dedication to getting in shape for this role. Jake went through intense amounts of training and discipline to acquire an absolutely shredded physique for this role. The fact that he achieved this while in his 40s is an inspiration to anyone who is trying to get in shape. It\'s on par with Hugh Jackman\'s preparation for Wolverine.\n\nNow for the bad stuff. The fight scenes are heavily reliant on CGI body doubles and shaky camera effects that stick out like a sore thumb in several scenes. If they had spent a little more time in perfecting these effects, it may have worked out as more believable. Jake\'s character also has superhero levels of plot armor that can induce a bit of eyerolling from anyone expecting realism out of the story. Plenty of scenes where he survives moments that would easily kill an ordinary man (i.e. Disarming several men with guns without getting blasted).\n\nYou\'re also not likely to enjoy the ending, as it was pretty intentionally peppered with plot holes in order to allow a potential sequel. This also may come as a shock to some of you, but Connor McGregor is (gasp) not a professionally trained actor. He was hired to play the crazy goon that he is in real life and it worked well for the film, in my opinion. Is it still worth watching?

Am I allowed to say that I liked it as much as the original? I only saw the Swayze one for the first time last year and really enjoyed, but I also really dug Doug Liman\'s recent update with Jake Gyllenhaal too, for different reasons. Jake himself is one of those reasons, he\'s breezy and effervescent as Dalton, disgraced ex MMA fighter relocated to the beautiful Florida Keys to defend a beachfront bar from relentless goons. The Keys setting is also another reason why I liked this a lot, it adds so much laidback atmosphere and picturesque scenery as backdrop for this simple, straightforward action flick that fills the shoes of the original adequately enough. I think that having a marauding meathead like Conor McGregor as the head goon was a bit of a misstep though; the guy is clearly not an actor and thinks he\'ll win over the screen by chewing more scenery than Gary Busey, but a modicum of restraint on his part might have kept his performance this side of the moon in terms of subtlety, and let other aspects flourish to the forefront. Sultry Daniela Melchior, smarmy Billy Magnusson and always terrific Joaquim De Almeida are good in supporting roles. I really liked Jake\'s performance here though; he adopts this laconic affability that hides a sickening darkness in his past, something he\'s always on the run from. The action is fearsome and often quite funny, the tone tropical and easygoing. My only gripe is it could have been a bit longer to flesh certain elements out and focused on Mcgregor\'s seething villain a tad less to pivot more over to other aspects the film has that it seemed to want to take more seriously.

It\'s the possibility of his rage that he always keeps at bay that makes him so watchable in this role as he beats up his enemies and then makes sure they\'re okay before actually driving them to the hospital.\n\nFrom the moment he\'s introduced, Conor McGregor is definitely something. It\'s the kind of performance that\'s never boring and never good. Every single line is delivered in hilariously awful fashion and yet he\'s one of the best parts of the film as he takes a very generically unhinged villain and makes it his own.\n\nDoug Liman\'s direction certainly has a lot of energy as it alternates between fights in the first person, drone shots and simply getting as close as possible to the action.

Updating the setting to a Florida road house rather than the original\'s biker bar gave the film a unique atmosphere and vibe that complemented its contemporary audience.

Not sure why that was (many speculations about that), but let\'s just enjoy that it is here.\n\nIt also feels like both Martin and Will never left ... the roles. It feels like they are those guys.

I cannot be mad at some of the flaws and the convinient timing of certain events. Nor the added relationships and backstories that might feel detached to a degree.

Bad boys for life is the third bad boy\'s movie. I would say that was a fun messy movie a symphony of violence and comedy. There was a lot of violence and I lounged a lot. There was a some stuff in the third act I\'m not gonna say what happens with the third action sequence is where myself the most and then it went completely jumped the shark and I was like that was fun. The movie has lot of funny moments, there was a lot of part where I chuckled I didn\'t laugh all everything the movie laughs there\'s almond. Which is surprising because considering they have not been in Bad Boys since 2003 and Lawrence has not been too active for the past decade because of unfortunate family issue. This movie is better then other ones because it has a much more structured plot and better direction with were it wants to go. I do not want to give away too much detail with the plot. However, you are getting yourself into any action movie with gunfights, chases and explosions. However, that may not necessarily sound appealing. But it definitely feels better if you watch the first two movies to see what you\'re getting yourself into, but this could also be your first one and you\'d still fit right in the movie. The director for Bad Boys 1 & 2 was Michael Bay. Who is known specifically for the extreme quick action movies. Now the new director duo, Bilall Fallah and Adil El Arbi brought back some of Michael Bay\'s craziness. Nevertheless, they also brought a new angle were the movie is not so one-dimensional anymore and they has some real life problems which Mike and Marcus have to overcome. This makes this movie so much more satisfying. Because it has been a 17 years wait. If you are going to watch this movie, I think the fact that you should not take this too seriously and only to watch just for enjoying it. Because thinking too much and maybe looking for plot holes will make your experience sour. The way the movie ended there might also have a fourth Bad Boys somewhere in the future. Both of the main characters are facing suffering with Marcus Brunette consider retiring from the police force after becoming a grandfather and decided to focus on his family but Mike Lowery quickly realizes he\'s not what he once was, and he might have to leave from the police force. They both feel vulnerable which definitely something that I wanted is in the past movies. Because nothing felt like a threat to them. Their relationship was in deep trouble because they were making their ways of impression that they have been doing throughout their whole lives. They all did exceptional work in their parts, but in the past movies having Will and Martin taking too much of the movie. Overall, if we\'re talking a good action movie with two great action stars with phenomenal chemistry. If you\'re a fun of this franchise oh boy I cannot wait for you all to see this goodness. I cannot wait to see what the response is and if you\'re not a fan this could win you over and It is my favorite movie of 2020.'),(423,23,'4/10','Bad Boys Derailed','misfitone38','2 February 2020','I never thought I would say this...but I wish Michael Bay had directed this. Maybe the earlier entries hold something dear to his heart and he wouldn\'t have allowed this to go off the rails.\n\nThe biggest casualty is the riffing between the Lawrence and Smith, which practically rips the soul right out of the franchise. The laughs from the first two movies came from the strong chemistry between the two leads and how they could argue in the middle of gun fights, car chases, etc. Here they just sound like an old married couple who have grown tired of each other.\n\nThe other casualty is the action scenes. The great Sam Peckinpah once said of the violence in his films that he wanted the audience to feel the impact of getting shot. Modern day use of CGI and such does the exact opposite. It feels more like you\'re watching somebody else play a video game. While some praise the visuals, I criticize its effect of pushing the viewer further away rather than drawing them in.\n\nThis could have been like Lethal Weapon IV and had some fun with its theme of the loose cannon dealing with aging.

No movie star seems to work harder or push himself further than Cruise these days. Ridiculously entertaining Top Gun: Maverick. Cruise was in his early 20s when he first played Pete \"Maverick\" Mitchell, the cocky young Navy pilot with the aviator sunglasses, the Kawasaki motorcycle and the need for speed. In the sequel, he\'s as arrogant and insubordinate as ever: Now a Navy test pilot in his late 50s, Maverick still knows how to tick off his superiors, as we see in an exciting opening sequence where he pushes a new plane beyond its limits. Partly as punishment, he\'s ordered to return to TOPGUN, the elite pilot-training school, and train its best and brightest for an impossibly dangerous new mission. And so the three screenwriters of Top Gun: Maverick - including Cruise\'s regular Mission: Impossible writer-director, Christopher McQuarrie - have taken the threads of the original and spun them into an intergenerational male weepie, a dad movie of truly epic proportions. They\'re tapping into nostalgia for the original, while aiming for new levels of emotional grandeur. To that end, the soundtrack features a Lady Gaga song, \"Hold My Hand.\" It\'s nowhere near as iconic a chart topper as the original movie\'s \"Take My Breath Away,\" but tugs at your heartstrings nonetheless. The action sequences are much more thrilling and immersive than in the original. You feel like you\'re really in the cockpit with these pilots, and that\'s because you are: The actors underwent intense flight training and flew actual planes during shooting. In that respect, Top Gun: Maverick feels like a throwback to a lost era of practical moviemaking, before computer-generated visual effects took over Hollywood. You start to understand why Cruise, the creative force behind the movie, was so driven to make it: In telling a story where older and younger pilots butt heads, and state-of-the-art F-18s duke it out with rusty old F-14s, he\'s trying to show us that there\'s room for the old and the new to coexist. He\'s also advancing a case for the enduring appeal of the movies and their power to transport us with viscerally gripping action and big, sweeping emotions.'),(443,24,'7/10','Great Flight Sequences, Cliche-Ridden Plot','Stoshie','18 June 2022','I don\'t share everyone\'s unbridled enthusiasm for this film. It is indeed a great popcorn flick, with outstanding aerial photography and maneuvers. But 10 stars? There are few, if any, movies that are perfect, and deserve that kind of rating.\n\nThe problem with the film is the plot. It is so filled with age-worn cliches that one could easily tell what was coming from beginning to end. I mean, you had to know who was going to save the day at the end, and you had to know what was going to happen when Maverick jumped out of Penny\'s window. Those are just two examples of the many obvious plot points that you could see coming a mile away. I could list them all, but it would take up too much space here. Basically the entire plot was entirely predictable.\n\nThe opening scene, especially, was straight out of Hollywood Screenplay Writing 101. I mean, seriously, how many times have we seen that subplot? Countless.\n\nThere were no characters in the movie, either. They were all caricatures, stereotypes. No depth to any of them.

But I now get it., its the nostalgia for the first film that fuels the scores for this film.\n\nHere is my take and why I think its an \"okay\" film, just not a great one. There really isn\'t a whole lot of meat and potatoes to this story. It\'s largely a copy pasta in large chunks from the older film but with newer, younger faces. Maverick is charged with training a squadron of top gun fighter pilots to destroy an enemy uranium enrichment plant that is about to come online and operational. But it seems the producers want to maximize the profits for this film and not offend anyone in the real world. So this enemy doesn\'t have a name or a geographical location. The enemy has 5th generation fighter jets and some James Bond evil villian sized SAM batteries around the mountain\'s summit. It is a snow covered terrain so that rules out many enemies in warmer climates.\n\nThen there is the lone aircraft carrier delivering these jet fighters to the enemies doorstep. Well, by now most people know that wouldn\'t be the case. Carriers are heavily guarded and their presence would trigger the attention of any adversary. No way could four F18 sneak in under radar to blow up this plant unless we accept the enemy isn\'t aware of a huge freakin carrier of their shores. So there is nothing resembling a realistic scenario and that kept me from enjoying the story too much.\n\nThe romantic relationship in the film has no chemistry. I just didn\'t feel any chemistry between Penny and Maverick. That\'s a first because you do have two very good looking actors and I always thought Tom Cruise to be great action actor. So no chemistry between Cruise and Jennifer Connelly is a bitter pill to swallow.\n\nWhat I did like about it was the cinematography and some of the action sequences with the dog fighting. But I didn\'t think the dog fighting were any better than the original film. In fact, the original film might have had better scenes. This film just has a lot of choppy editing to imply action.\n\nI think its a 6/10, but not a chance it\'s a 9/10. Maybe if they added a Tom Clancy inspired screenplay to the film I might have given it a 9. Maybe a team of seals to do recon before having the jets engage and with the aircraft carrier companied by a battlegroup flotilla. Aircraft Carriers just don\'t end up secretly off the shore of adversarial country completely alone, not in the real world.'),(446,24,'10/10','Flying High','DarkVulcan29','27 May 2022','Top Gun (1986) made Tom Cruise a star, and now 36 years later he jumps back in role of Pete Mitchell AKA Maverick almost like he never left.\n\nMaverick never seems let his age slow him down, and still is cocky has ever, and is ordered to train a bunch of young pilots for a deadly mission, but sees a little bit of himself in them, and must get them working together has a team.\n\nTom Cruise is great has Maverick, who is coming to terms with the past.

This is why I LOVE Tom Cruise Post-Mid-1992. Aside from the RARE misfire, cough, cough, The Mummy, when Tom Cruise wants a movie to be better than perfect, he pushes it past Mach 10.\n\nThe first half of this adventure made me feel this is the perfect and worthy sequel to the original. AND THEN...the second half kicked in thoroughly SURPASSING the original by a landslide. Now, it certainly will not have the impact on the 2020s as the original did for the 1980s - that\'s lightning that can\'t be caught twice. But, rest assured: this simultaneously saluted the 1986 classic and then told it to hold its beer.\n\nMaverick never changed. And just went he was about to use up his seemingly endless supply of luck, he got recruited back into the \"Top Gun\" division to get the elite ready for a, dare I?, almost Impossible Mission. Oh, and there\'s a ton of drama and obligatory dick-measuring thrown in.\n\nWhat matters most is: the setup for the film takes place perfectly in the first act giving us clear direction (something the original lacked,) and gave us goals with character building to anticipate and cheer on. When the climax began, it\'s WAS exactly what I wanted, until it went on another 15 minutes to make the movie SOAR beyond my expectations.\n\nWhile the acting was superb from the Veterans, it wasn\'t all that great from the fresh new recruits. That was to be expected. Much like their characters in the movie, they\'re learning to be the best. And they may someday.\n\nThe movie\'s music is not as great as the original, but the movie used it sparingly, correctly and with some great new tracks. The original knew it had a killer soundtrack and overdid it. This one showed the restraint it needed.\n\nIf you loved the first one, there\'s virtually no way you wouldn\'t love this even more. It\'s absolutely perfect for those who were there buying tickets for the original and it\'s also great for newbies so they can learn to appreciate the classics and understand: with age comes experience and that should never be mocked. It should be learned from and used to progress.\n\nAnd to Top it all off, all of the practical stunts and aerial shots made 10x more sense and easier to follow this time around. I just rewatched the original last night for only the second time (the first being on home video in 2015) and my head was literally spinning to follow the action in the sky.

Actually I would even argue that the rating also had something to do with it. Watching it on the big screen also helps a lot of course. My summary line is actually a quote from the movie. Not just the first one, but one that is being said here too. And you will get the full impact of that sentence, of those words, if you know what they mean and why they are said.\n\nThere are quite a few connections to the first movie, but there is also nods to real life. Especially with Val Kilmer in mind. And all is serving the story - even the real life struggle Kilmer has, that gets woven into the character Iceman. So there are two of the big stars of the first one name checked - what about Kelly McGillis though? Well don\'t hold your breath (it is being taken away, sorry for the pun)! She is not returning. Now you could be mad at the movie for that - or you could salute it for bringing \"back\" a character that was only name checked in the first movie - and being played by the wonderful Jennifer Connely.\n\nNow is she as beautiful as ever? Yes. But she is also close to the age of Tom Cruise that some other names could have been. Of course do not overthink the age thing, because you\'d find that her real age would have been inappropriate during the time of the first movie ... just saying. Again: do not overthink it at all.\n\nThose things out of the way, we get introduced to a whole bunch of new characters. There probably is not as much ... well male on male energy here as there was in the first one. Even in the dialog - you just feel it. Don\'t give me that look (and yes I know it is the only one you\'ve got - especially when I bring the puns)! There is more than a coherent story - and the movie takes its time to tell it. There is plenty of action too.\n\nThere is also technical talk that I didn\'t totally understand. But it is not necessary to get the movie or enjoy it. And then there is the ending - and what a perfect ending this has. So much so, that I decided it deserves the 10 rating I finally gave it. It may copy many things from the first movie (call it homage), especially the intro but also some story beats, but it still stands ... or rather flies on its own! Just buckle your seatbelt, because you may get dizzy.\n\nFirst time watching I could spot the music cues from the first one, but there were also some fresh elements to it. If I didn\'t know Lady Gaga was at least partly (big parts if I understood correctly) responsible for the soundtrack, I wouldn\'t have guessed myself to be honest. As it is, one of the biggest highlights in cinemas this year - the waiting was worth it. If you feel the need .. the need for speed - your need will be satisfied here (or rather in cinemas). Even being able to predict story points will not take away anything from the experience you can have with this. Enjoy.'),(450,24,'7/10','Top Gun: The Force Awakens','damianphelps','17 November 2022','Firstly before my small complaint I will point out that I do like the movie.\n\nNow the complaint. This movie uses the exact same formula as Star Wars: The Force Awakens, it remakes the original film almost scene for scene and adds a few new bits. Both films treating the audience with a little bit of contempt whilst cashing in on the nostalgia market.\n\nHaving said that, its a fun movie. Teller, as Goose 2.0, works particularly well. It was also great to see Kilmer, despite his current health concerns (he could have been a dynamo for the film if well).\n\nIts fun, loud and obnoxious which is what a Top Gun movie should be :)\n75 out of 104 found this helpful.

It\'ll definitely offer big audiences who lived through the 80s with their powerful levels of nostalgia, just like Scream fans would\'ve received a nice touch from the new Scream, which is perfectly reasonable.\n\nThis film actually lives with some pretty good direction, admirable cinematography, emotional connections and tamer content, but that doesn\'t overlap how it turned out. In fact, those are the only perks throughout this movie. The story is overlong and very boring to watch, just after being predictable and filled with attempted elements that just don\'t work out.

Amazing set designs, incredible character building, action sequences that are perfectly choreographed. This is one of the, if not, most ambitious films with a flawless execution. The fact that the director\'s vision is so blended with Tom Cruise and other actors is very effective on the traceability of the film. Tom Cruise is a machine. He knows what audiences want and he delivers.

The film did a good job executing its grit and thrills. Decent directing and amazing performances. The filmmakers did a fantastic job bringing Suzanne Collins\' book to life. It\'s not the usual kind of blockbuster that focuses to its loudness. It\'s a film with moving drama and has its suspense.\n\nIt\'s pretty easy to understand everything about this story and its world. We get to know most of it and the entire film is intriguing and undeniably entertaining. The cast brings most of it to life. Jennifer Lawrence is simply fantastic as Katniss. Josh Hutcherson is okay but does not tie with Lawrence. Woody Harrelson, Elizabeth Banks, Wes Bentley, Donald Sutherland, and Stanley Tucci didn\'t get a lot of screen time but they were good to their roles.\n\nThe movie is great in suspense and drama. It doesn\'t have a lot of score which makes it moving and compelling. The moments of Katniss in the arena are stirring. Thrilling music score is a great effect to these sequences. Unlike our blockbusters these days, the film doesn\'t focus too much to the CGI and the explosions. There isn\'t really much explosions here. Surprisingly, the filmmakers aren\'t lazy to create a non-CGI set(except the chariots). There is, of course, still CGI here but not as excessive as our modern blockbusters. The action is pretty good with the shaky camera. It\'s nicely shot gives enough momentum and excitement. Most people complain to that though. Lastly, the production design is beyond decent.\n\nThe Hunger Games is thrilling and solid enough. Decent filmmaking made it spectacular. It\'s amazing and intriguing enough to start a big series. It succeeds to become a solid and one and not a lackluster like Twilight or I Am Number Four. I don\'t know what else to say about it, but it\'s silent, gritty, and compelling.'),(457,25,'7/10','Not quite the Battle Royale','hani_78696','8 October 2012','Thrilling,Engaging and entertaining dystopian action sci-fiction flick.

Especially the make up and movie sets are very beautiful and elegant which make the people from novel come to life. Now,considering the novel,this movie adaption misses a few things i wanted to see on screen. One is I expected it to be more violent on screen with a R Rating but they made PG-13 Stuff, i don\'t know why,to make more money i guess. That shaky cinematography too. some of the important messages had been cut down. These things really disappoint me because i loved the novel and wanted it to be more precise. other than that it is good popcorn entertainer. Loved Jennifer Lawrence though. Acting is far far better than that Kristen-NO-Expression-Stewart. Not only Jennifer but all the actors did their job very good.

It just exists as a spectacle, a finished product that defies any critical lens.\n\nI could go on about the particulars of the adaptation -- the ridiculousness of the entire Capital setting, or the sometimes disorienting shakycam work, or the great cast of adults patiently playing supporting characters -- or the source material -- the gestures at social commentary, the way that the story protects Katniss from ever having to morally sully herself -- but they all seem to be beside the point. Look. The movie has the things that happened in the book, but in a movie, competently shot and acted, with absolutely no risks taken. If you liked the book, or want to learn what this whole Hunger Games thing is about without having to read the book, you\'ll probably like this. It\'s a digestible film, even an enjoyable one, but in the end it\'s not really interesting or memorable. But to be fair, it wasn\'t meant to be.'),(459,25,'7/10','Nice adaption from the book, but...','excavator','22 March 2012','One of the things I liked the most about reading \'The Hunger Games\' was the intensity of how it was written. Feeling the story seemed maybe even more important than reading it, so when I went to see the movie, my expectations were very high.\n\nOn the upside: Great performance by the main characters, excellent visuals and well directed.\n\nOn the downside: The book gives a lot of context as to how the characters feel and how things have come to be the way they are. The movie changes a number of things to make it at all possible to show the story and for me the choices made took down the quality of the story a bit. To give at least some context, it took the movie a while to get really started and even despite that, some of the characters, again in my opinion, didn\'t really develop in depth the way they should.\n\nLong story short, I liked the movie and thought it was a nice adaptation from the book, but it lacked a bit the intensity from the book.'),(460,25,'10/10','Perspective from a VERY senior citizen','The_DATo','24 May 2022','This is not so much a review, everything has already been said in the other postings, but rather my experience with this movie and book.\n\nOK, look, I\'m probably old enough to be the grandfather of most of the people submitting reviews to this movie. I am not into the teen age drivel that seems to be everywhere you look these days but .....\n\nI first heard about the story when the book came out. It seemed you couldn\'t turn around without hearing it being discussed everywhere. The enormous hype made me mildly curious, but not so curious that I wanted to read the book. Fast forward several years: the book had been out, the movie hade been out, the DVD had been out and only then did I accidentally stumble across the DVD at the library. I could check it out for free and if I didn\'t like it I could turn it off after ten minutes ... so, why not?\n\nI immediately found myself captivated by the beautiful cinematography and background theme and despite the over-the-top and ridiculous costumes and makeup of the people in The Capitol I decided to continue watching. I was drawn deeper and deeper into the story and the characters and after about a fourth of the way through I knew I was hooked. The acting, starting with Jennifer Lawrence, was exceptionally good. I have to go through about 25 movies before I find one that I can say I absolutely loved ... this was a 25er.\n\nTo finish my story: unbelievably, when I returned the DVD to the library, on a table in the lobby of the library where they sold used books cheaply, I found a mint condition copy of the book (the big paperback format) for fifty cents. I grabbed it. I began reading the book when I got home and couldn\'t put it down even though I already knew the story. Collins\' writing style was as captivating as her story and the very few differences between the movie and the book were not worth mentioning. Actually, I thought the movie version of the ending was better (just couldn\'t imagine Rue as a werewolf).\n\nI now own, and have seen and read, all of the books and movies of the franchise and consider them among some of the best entertainment of my life. SO it seems the old adage is wrong because you really CAN teach an old dog new tricks. Other young adult movies came out after \'The Hunger Games\' which tried to capitalize on the same type of theme and they, by comparison, have failed miserably in my estimation.'),(461,25,'7/10','Predictable but Dark. Starts Terrifically.','tobyjames03','31 July 2019','An unfortunate catalyst that propelled the trend of teenage protagonist led book adaptations, of dystopian futures. Divergent and Maze Runner followed, both failing to complete their respective stories. Perhaps that has tainted the memory of a satisfactory film, undefinable by genre.\n\nIt\'s easy to forget that way back in 2012 this was fresh and new, tonally dark cinema, aiming for the teenage demographic. Perhaps that\'s a large reason for the success of the franchise, it was new and interesting, everything since has just been a rehash, located in a different world.\n\nRefreshingly dark and mature, visually graphic, The Hunger Games has a lot going for it, as a visual spectacle, not so much as an immersive and compelling story. Narratively it meanders, without intent, there\'s a station to arrive at but not the train track to get there. Tonally gloomy at times, balance is hard to find. Switches in mood make the texture of the atmosphere uneven, because changes are jarring and misplaced. The edit failed to maximise the potential seeping throughout. Scenes are drawn out and end on odd notes, something that could\'ve been tightened up in post-production. Additionally more cuts to and through between the Games and the world at present would\'ve helped to increase tension while the story pondered, the scale and public reaction isn\'t documented anywhere near enough, if at all. Personally I feel the editing really trips this film up, it\'s quite easily 10-15 minutes too long, feeling even longer due to the fact of how much sitting around there is.\n\nStretched so far it\'s see through, the ending is blatant from the get go, meaning there\'s not much to keep you interested after the half hour mark.\n\nGary Ross shows wonderful craft and delicacy when concerning the dark themes of oppressed society, life without choice and just how bleak living in a dictatorship is. In the first act he manages to craft a tone and atmosphere that reeks of desperation, fear, the empty void of hopelessness and life without control. Yet he lifts the mood with the slightest and smallest of scenes between Kat and Gale, serving as a reminder of humanity\'s ability to dream and aspire for a better world. Each shot set in District 12 is delightful, sombre chills run through every vein as you are enraptured in fear and anxiety. The build up to and throughout the reaping is tense and nauseating, interactions with Kat and her sister are filmed so preciously. Sound is well utilised through the overdrawn run-time, music is allowed to overrun and dominate, drowning out the world perfectly and symbolically. An example that comes to mind concerning the sound is when Kat offers herself up, her screaming juxtaposed against the silence sets her out from the rest, nailing her on as the protagonist we will all route for. Selfless.\n\nThis was Jennifer Lawrence\'s big break in the public eye, she left a good impression. Portrayed with care, Katniss is delicately played when is necessary but can easily surge with passion when needed. Reminiscent of an indie film portrayal, Jennifer showcases her range and hits all the marks, and you, in all the right places.\n\nHunger Games starts off brilliantly, it\'s exhilarating and tense, filled with subtlety. Has a terrific lead performance that powers you through. It\'s weighed down by an underwhelming narrative, that\'s evened out with an enjoyable character arc. Sadly it gets wrapped up in it itself, losing its awareness of how sick a situation this is, and rather than point it out, chooses to accept the societal issues, it so cleverly addressed in the beginning. We then drift and chunder toward the inevitable ending.\n\nNevertheless I\'d quite happily re-watch the first act, but would have no qualms with skipping the rest.\n\nIt\'s a solid piece of film-making.'),(462,25,'10/10','A true game-changer for movies aimed at teens.','GlimmerBunny','19 March 2012','Let me start by saying that I\'m a huge fan of the \"The Hunger Games\" book series by Suzanne Collins. I\'ve read them countless times and when I found out they were making a movie of them a little over a year ago I was very excited. But I was also worried.\n\n\"The Hunger Games\" is not very easy source material. The book is written in first person narrative with very detailed descriptions of everything form the characters\' looks to the strange futuristic devices they use in Panem, the future version of the U.S. where the story takes place. I couldn\'t imagine that they would be able to convey every detail as I had imagined it and make the story believable without an R-rating or a huge budget. All of my concerns were wiped away when I saw the movie.\n\nI\'ve never seen a more faithful adaption of a book in my life. All of the costumes, the sets, the locations, the cast (I\'ll talk more about them in a while) and the pacing is as if they were exactly replicated from the book. And the small things that do differ or are added (such as more insight to the gamemakers\' control room) only add to the amazing world Collins created and improve the narrative movie-wise. And the movie is great for people who haven\'t read the books as well. Not once did I feel as if something was vague or badly explained.\n\nThe cast is stellar. Jennifer Lawrence as Katniss carries the movie and makes me regret complaining about her casting because she was too \"hot\" and not starved enough. She IS Katniss and one can feel the graveness of an situation just by looking at one of her expressions. Josh Hutcherson as Peeta is also a true breakout performance. The way he looks at Katniss will makes girls all over the world envy her, just like it\'s supposed to be. Other standouts in the cast include Stanley Tucci as the flamboyant talk-show host Caesar Flickerman, Woody Harrelson as the sarcastic but caring mentor Haymitch and Wes Bentley as the sinister game-maker Seneca Crane (his final scene might be the best one in the whole movie). The child actors Willow Shields and Amandla Stendberg who portrays Prim and Rue are believable and heartbreaking even though they\'re inexperienced.\n\nDespite the PG-13 rating the movie doesn\'t gloss over or sugarcoat anything for their audience. The violence may not be gloriously graphic but it\'s still there. People will feel the tributes\' pain and despair and not even realize the violence isn\'t gory until you\'ve left the theater. The movie also deals with important themes like survival, governmental control, grief and helplessness. There is a minor love story subplot, but it doesn\'t distract from the movies main themes. In my opinion I think it rather improves them by showing some light in the dark.\n\nThe only complaint I can think of is that the movie feels too short. It\'s almost two and a half hours long, but it feels as if it goes by in a blink. I will have to see it again to fully pay attention to every detail (such as the costumes and animation of the Capitol, which looked amazing). But this is still not me saying that the movie is rushed, because as I stated the source material is very dense and the filmmakers managed include almost everything.\n\nPeople are expecting this to become the next Twilight-style teen movie franchise. I can\'t say I think the two stories have anything in common even though I hope \"The Hunger Games\" will do as well at the box office. But if the first movie is any indication of the quality of what\'s to come - this will be a series way out of Twilight\'s league.'),(463,25,'nfunkymonkey8','Two Words: Battle Royale','18 April 2013','Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.','Seeing the \"Hunger Games\" series gain so much recognition is difficult to fathom; especially when it\'s more or less a blatant copy of \"Battle Royale\", a Japanese novel (1996), movie (2000), and manga (2000-2005). I\'ve read the entire series of \"Hunger Games\" (2008), and not only is the writing style bland, but the plot is exceedingly unoriginal and not \'unique\' like many of you are claiming it to be. Like the \"Battle Royale\" manga, \"Hunger Games\" includes love triangles, a group of teenagers randomly chosen (BR: by class HG: by district), plans to overthrow authority, teens given weapons and forced into a death match, a pair working together to undermine the game with the help of an older mentor who had previously won the game, both female and male main leads, a corrupted government, signal fires and bird calls, a reality TV show program (which IS in the English adaption of the manga (2006) for the series unlike many of you have known), and the list goes on and on. Evidence of these unconcealed similarities can be found on various Internet articles (whose writers I sincerely thank). I urge you to go right now and read the manga or novel of Battle Royale online so that you can compare the two series. The author of \"Hunger Games\" blatantly claimed (*cough* lied *cough) that she supposedly never even knew of \"Battle Royale\", so you can\'t use \'inspiration\' as an excuse anymore. Instead, she blurted out nonsense about Roman mythology and the Iraq war since she doesn\'t want to admit her source of inspiration is a contemporary. How convenient for her own success since \"Battle Royale\" is a Japanese series that isn\'t well known in North America. She basically made an American-version of the series that contains less gruesome content and involves districts in place of school classes. Even if she truly did not know about \"Battle Royale\" or mysteriously forgot about it in the back of her mind, it is still part of an author\'s job to confirm the originality of his or her own to-be published works through researching. I\'m posting this all of over the web so that \"Battle Royale\" can at least receive some acknowledgment that the \"Hunger Games\" author denied. Sure enough, both series also share resemblances with \"The Lord of the Flies\" and \"The Running Man\". However, unlike the HR author, the BR author has not denied this inspiration. Moreover, the \"Hunger Games\" is more like a rip-off of \"Battle Royale\" than an inspiration since the majority of the plot elements are nearly identical. There\'s a fine line between the words \'inspiration\' and \'copy\', and \"Hunger Games\" has extended far past it. There are also many popular American series that were inspired by Japanese series such as \"The Matrix\" from \"Ghost in the Shell\", however they rightfully gave credit for the \'original\' series unlike a certain someone. I sincerely apologize if I seem rash with my word choice, but it\'s so aggravating that Suzanne Collins had dare stated that she wasn\'t inspired by \"Battle Royale\" when she clearly was. What\'s more contemptible is that she\'s getting not only famous from her rip-off, but she\'s also obtaining vast amounts of money from it. But hey, that\'s how reality works, right? Therefore, I don\'t care if this is marked as spam or hauled with negative comments from \"Hunger Game\" fanatics. As long as it reveals to some people the credit \"Battle Royale\" genuinely deserves, then I\'m satisfied. Nonetheless, the movie\'s portrayal of \"Hunger Games\" is quite exceptional in comparison to other movies adapted from books, which is why I am rating this 2/10 instead of 1/10.'),(464,25,'7/10','Enjoyable but very flawed','texanvkg','23 March 2012','Overall it is great to see the novel brought to life on the big-screen. First of all, kudos to the actors - each does a marvelous job with their roles. Harrelson, Lawrence, Hutchinson, Tucci, Banks and the rest of the cast - they all nail their characters and do them honor.\n\nThe heart of the story is intact, unfortunately there are many significant elements from the novel entirely missing, or changed to the point they lose the depth of meaning they were intended to have. Unlike some of the sub-plot and story elements left out of the Potter and LOTR series, these missing and adulterated items matter greatly, and lessen the quality of the movie. I will give the producers credit for building Seneca Crane\'s role in an effective way that answers many questions for those that have not read the books.\n\nFinally - production values. You will suffer significant eyestrain after 2.5 hours of glaring close-ups. All of the action is shot so close and is so muddled it is almost impossible to determine what is happening. The chariot display is shown either to close or too far away, and in both cases so fast that the impact of the glorious entrance and introduction of the tributes is lost. The CG shots (thankfully there are few of them) look like leftovers from a Syfy channel production. This may be the worst big-budget production to hit the big screen in years. Although Ross worked well with the actors, he did not handle the action epic elements well at all. The cinematography is atrocious and the whole production looks cheap.\n\nYou will enjoy the movie, but you will also wish for the grand and respectful care-taking that was given the Potter and Lord of the Rings franchises.'),(465,25,'bob the moo','Surprisingly safe and sanitised – lacks the horror, satire and commentary it could and should have had','3 September 2012','Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.','There was a great deal of hype and fuss when The Hunger Games came out as a film and perhaps I should have known I was not target audience because up till then I had never heard of the book series (or indeed that a film was being made). Although with the usual hoopla that goes with any large film, quite a few critics I respect gave it surprisingly good reviews and I decided I would check it out at some point as it seemed to offer more than just a copy of Battle Royale for American teenagers. With all the fuss (and teenage audience) I was very happy to let it go by in the cinemas and instead I waited for the DVD.\n\nThe film offers a lot of potential and this potential is evident from the start because it sets out its stall to be many things. Firstly there is plenty of room for satire by virtue of this exaggerated futuristic world where this annual murder is presented as both entertainment and also as a way of punishing the masses and keeping them in their place while those with the power enjoy the best of life. Secondly there is the opportunity to draw the audience into being a viewer of this very thing and then confronting us with the horror of what it really means so that there is at least a part of us questioning what we\'re finding entertaining. I wasn\'t looking for this to be some incredibly dark film that spits out an audience full of self-loathing and introspection, but I did expect it to be intelligent and impacting on some level to make it stand out from being just a teen-friendly adventure story.\n\nThe film itself surprised me by falling far short of what it could have been and squandering or ignoring most of the things of the potential it had. In terms of the satire, it never convinced me of the world it had created – it seemed unnecessarily excessive and didn\'t have enough truth to it to make me believe. I got the impression that it wasn\'t particularly interested in making the world function as a real place either – just that it was on screen was enough. As a place for commentary or digs at real things, it wasn\'t that it picked easy targets or easy shots, it was more a matter of it not really having much interest in saying anything beyond a few very basic things. This is a problem not only because it wasted potential but also because the first hour or so of this film is entirely in this world.\n\nThe second hour is within the games itself and as such it does have dramatic moments as one would expect (it is after all, an expensive Hollywood thriller), however these are fewer than I would have liked and also a lot less impacting – I watched most of it with a removal that I shouldn\'t have had. The delivery of children violently murdering other is only horrifying in regards how sanitised and unhorrific it is. I wasn\'t looking for it to be really gory or to revel in the blood, but it certainly should not have been something that I watch without any reaction. This lack of horror (even just emotional horror) leaves the game as a rather hollow affair which eventually turns into a standard thriller where we root for the \"good\" kids over the \"bad\" kids, even though it would have been stronger to have not drawn that very easy line.\n\nThe performances are mostly solid even though the majority have little to work with. Lawrence is a good actress and she adds a weight to her character tat doesn\'t seem to come from anywhere but her. I liked her throughout – even terrible \"fire\" special effects seemed unable to make her look bad.

First off let me start by saying that I have read all three books, and I must admit that the trailer made me a bit hesitant. I mean in the trailer they didn\'t get the little details right (for instance Katniss\'s backpack is suppose to be orange and it isn\'t) but that didn\'t stop me from seeing the movie, and it SHOULD NOT stop you either! The movie followed the books as closely as a \"PG-13\" rating would allow, and the things they did change didn\'t distract from the overall movie.\n\nI don\'t want to say too much, but this movie is a magnificent start to what I hope will be an epic trilogy.

Not to mention that there is plenty of suspense and action to keep you glued to the screen (even if you\'ve already read the books!)\n\nNow I now it\'s difficult to watch a movie when you\'ve already read the books.

Perhaps never before has that hole been as large as the abyss left by the HARRY POTTER series, given the rapid release schedule of those films. It\'s 2012, and there\'s no new POTTER. Some might argue that the TWILIGHT series fills the void, yet not only is that franchise little more than a punchline to all but the hardcore fans, it too is set to (hopefully) wrap up this year. Enter THE HUNGER GAMES, seemingly a sure thing based on the POTTER formula: hugely successful series of young adult novels? Check. Talented cast of young leads and respected character actors as support? Naturally. Large scale production and, crucially, marketing budget? You bet. So is THE HUNGER GAMES worthy of taking up the POTTER mantle?\n\nAmazingly, it might be even better.\n\nWhile no-one would suggest that THE HUNGER GAMES is the most original new property coming from the Hollywood machine, Lionsgate and director Gary Ross adapt Suzanne Collins\' source material in just the right ways, jettisoning un-cinematic elements and focusing on the meat of the story right from the opening frame. Rather than build the world of Panem through tedious exposition and backstory, Ross instead drops us directly into the grim life of Katniss Everdeen (Jennifer Lawrence) and her journey to the Hunger Games, a perverse spectacle inflicted annually on 24 unfortunate teens. While the POTTER series certainly headed in a darker direction as it went on, THE HUNGER GAMES is horrifically bleak right from the get go, and Ross\' decision to show instead of tell, through the use of wonderfully expressive, fluid camera-work, paints an ugly picture indeed. There are so many refreshing elements at work here, with an active, independent, and strong female protagonist and a startling absence of overblown CGI, but it\'s the nastiness that makes this film unique. Delivering a family appropriate experience while retaining the majority of the violence and unpleasantness of the novel is a delicate proposition which Ross mostly pulls off, but one can\'t help wondering about the potential for a much harder, R-rated cut of the film. It\'s an understandable issue to be sure, but an issue nonetheless.\n\nWhere THE HUNGER GAMES perhaps doesn\'t fare so well is in the internal strife faced by Katniss, particularly in regards to potential love interests Gale (Liam Hemsworth) and Peeta (Josh Hutcherson). Collins\' novel has much more freedom to explore, and even dwell on, Katniss\' emotional state through inner monologue, but given the nature of film, particularly a mainstream blockbuster such as this, much less room is left for introspection, and some of the character dynamics and relationships suffer in comparison. Katniss\' independence is unfortunately undercut by the franchise building mentality of the film, setting up an inevitable love triangle to be explored in two potential sequels. That said, she\'s still a much more positive, appropriate female role model than TWILIGHT\'s limp and passive Bella Swan, or indeed any young female character in recent memory. THE HUNGER GAMES is an important film at many levels, one which heralds the birth of the next big Hollywood franchise, and if the quality of the first installment is maintained then the sequels can\'t come soon enough.\n\ntinribs27.wordpress.com'),(471,26,'5/10','Verona Parker is easily one of the worst characters ever written for the screen','DocteurDream','30 January 2024','Verona Parker is easily one of the worst characters ever written for the screen, takes away everything this movie aspires to be.

Madonna was great as the damsel in distress, she really impressed me and added depth to her performance.

At the same time, he informally adopts a street kid (Charlie Korsmo), encounters problems with girlfriend Tess Trueheart (Glenne Headly), and flirts with Breathless Mahoney (Madonna).\n\nIf I were to rate Dick Tracy only on production design--sets, matte paintings, costumes, special make-up, color schemes, and so on--I wouldn\'t hesitate to give it a 10. Throughout its length, the film looks fantastic--like a surreal, day-glo, pop art film noir. Super saturated primary and secondary colors dominate, occasionally offset by rich tertiary colors. The colors are consistently combined in effective, varied and intriguing ways. The surreal \"locations\" are a combination of matte paintings and sets seamlessly melded in a manner that remains technically impressive. The make-up effects for Dick Tracy\'s bizarre characters are excellent. They manage to both capture the precise look of the comic books villains and appear realistic at the same time. If the film were just a set of art photos and/or paintings, it would be one of the masterpieces of at least the 1990s.\n\nHowever, as a film, there\'s a story that writers Jim Cash and Jack Epps, Jr. want to tell. That story is a complete mess. For some godforsaken reason, Cash and Epps try to include every villain from the Tracy comics that they can remember. They seem to also include half of the plot lines they can remember. But they forget to write in any explanation or motivation for why Tracy is going after whomever he\'s going after at a given moment. Combined with overly quick, abrupt editing that too often bounces back and forth between unrelated scenes, the plot seems as if Cash and Epps set out bullet points of villains, villain interconnections and schemes, then threw them together almost randomly in a string of non-sequiturs.\n\nCharacters played by well-known and capable actors are completely wasted. There\'s just not enough time to get into them. Others, such as Madonna, seem to have demanded contractual clauses that guaranteed screen time (in this case featuring singing) whether the appearance serviced the story or not. Some of the cast, such as Pacino, crazily overact. Others, such as William Forsythe as Flattop, turn in understated performances. I don\'t mind either style (and who is more fun to watch chewing scenery than Pacino?) but Beatty, who also directed, appears to have not known what he wanted to shoot for in that capacity. Part of the problem could be confusion due to the script being such a mess. Beatty, by the way, displays a peculiar inability to change his facial expression, which remains cemented in a seemingly new character--I\'ll name him \"Frogface\"--throughout the film (maybe that\'s how Beatty always is and I just didn\'t notice it so much before). In terms of his vocal phrasing and general emoting, Beatty portrays Tracy as a cross between Bob Newhart, Keanu Reeves and Harrison Ford. I like all of those other actors, and I\'m definitely a fan of oddities, but in this context, I\'m not sure it works. I was never a big reader of the Tracy comics, though. Maybe it\'s a perfect fit, but I\'m guessing that it makes as much sense as Gilbert Gottfried as Batman (which, come to think of it, I\'d like to see, but obviously more as a spoof).\n\nThere appear to be fans of this film, so the plot must not be such a mess and the performances must not be so questionable in everyone\'s opinion.

Sign in to vote.','This is a marvelous film. Warren Beatty managed to film it just like a comic book MIGHT be brought to film with humourously grotesque and bizarre characters, beautiful colours, and a plot that really only could have come from a comic book. The buildings, set design, make-up, and props are like nothing I have ever seen in film before. Now, never having read the original strip leaves me out as far as making probably very insightful comparisons with this film and the original source. That being said, I think that Beatty, although drastically changing some of the villains in the film to fit smaller roles, tried to keep the spirit of the film inside the comic strip. Does that make sense? Probably not. Anyway, Dick Tracy offers a lot. It is a visual feast with a decent story and some prime time stars doing some things you may not expect from them. Beatty is very good as the lawmen, but much of the supporting cast steals many scenes from him. Al Pacino as Big Boy Caprice is sensational as an over-the-top thug out to get every criminal under his control, while he intermittenly quotes folks like Nietchze, Jefferson, and other historical figures. Dustin Hoffman as Mumbles is wonderful - if you can finally figure out that it is him(notice in the scene where a stenographer is taking down what he says((That is Oscar winner Kathy Bates!))). James Caan has a brief yet good scene with Pacino Godfather style and Beatty gives Michael J. Pollard and Estelle Parsons cameos as well(both co-starring with him in Bonnie and Clyde). Then there is Madonna. She tries her best to live up to her name of Breathless and does a VERY credible job at it. And then of course there is the music of Stephen Sondheim, an Oscar winner for this film. It is very good and in some ways more memorable than much of what goes on in the film. Perhaps a song here or there might have been cut, but for the most part the music greatly added to the overall effects created in the film. Is Dick Tracy great? No, but it is a whole lot better than it is generally given credit for. In some ways its innovation must be reviewed again.

The timeless and imaginative settings capture the essence rather than reality of the city . There\'s so much music in the movie mostly from Mandy Patinkin and especially Madonna as the singer Breathless Mahoney doing her best screen acting to date . Good though excessive performances from Al Pacino who is perfectly cast as the gangster Big Boy looking like a caricaturist impression of a cartoon and splendid Dustin Hoffman as his hoodlum named Mumbles . The make-up used for all of the villains was based directly on how they were drawn by Chester Gould in the original comic strip , the only exception was Big Boy Caprice, whose make-up was designed by Al Pacino himself. People expecting Gothic scenarios and spectacular action of Batman may be disappointed , but moviegoers will be thrilled . Colorful and stylistically superior cinematography by the Italian Vittorio Storaro , shot in a few colors , the main colors in the film are only six that the original comic strip appeared in: red, blue, yellow, green, orange, purple, plus black and white .

After making every villain a lively cartoon caricature, director/star Warren Beatty either forgot or (out of vanity?) declined to provide himself with comparable make-up to match his character\'s familiar, square-jawed profile. The comic book design is certainly dazzling, with its artificial sets and primary colors (all \"eight\" of them, according to Beatty), but without a story to hold it all together the novelty wears thin quickly. A successful film needs more than just clever make-up and production design, but Dick Tracy offers nothing else of interest; the monotonous, jury-rigged plot moves back and forth without progressing anywhere, and the presence of Madonna is an instant liability.

Those colors, for me at least, make this an absolutely fascinating film to watch. There are literally thousands of scenes I wish could freeze and somehow convert them to a painting to study for their artwork.\n\nThe characters and the story don\'t match up to the greatness of the photography, but they are all over-the-top, especially the villains.

Another good addition is Charlie Korsmo as the delinquent young boy Dick and Tess take under their wing.

Breathless Mahoney\'s dancers are one of the highlights; great job on this front.\n\nUnfortunately, the story was only so-so compelling. It amazes me how blockbuster filmmakers will blow all this money to get the \"look\" of the film perfect and then drop the ball on the most important element – the STORY.

When I first watched it I thought it was a kids\' movie and I was at that age where anything like that I hated. Happily, I feel much differently about the film now that I\'m older.\n\nDick Tracy is a live-action cartoon, with eye-popping visuals decked out in bright primary colors. It\'s a beautiful film to behold. Everyone involved in the stylized look of this movie should be proud. The sets, the lighting, the matte paintings, the makeup and effects are all superior to any CGI crap we get today. Real work and passion went into this and it shows.\n\nThe cast is great. Beatty is criticized by many for not being the right fit for Tracy or for being too old. While he\'s not a perfect representation of the character, I feel he does quite well and his age never occurred to me while watching it. Madonna gives easily her best performance in this movie. That\'s meant slightly as a slam I guess, as most of her other work is very weak. But it\'s also meant as a compliment. Here she plays to her strengths: sex appeal and \"oomph.\" Her double entendres and skin-tight dresses make Breathless Mahoney a very memorable character. There\'s also some fine support from Glenne Headley and Charlie Korsmo. And who can forget the villains! Chester Gould\'s distinctive-looking villains come to life thanks to superb makeup, played in many cases by uncredited stars. The leader of the bunch is Big Boy Caprice, played by the wonderfully over-the-top Al Pacino. Pacino was having a lot of fun with the role and it shows.\n\nMy only real complaint lies in the music. Not the Stephen Sondheim songs -- they\'re great. But the Danny Elfman musical score is way too similar to the one he did for Batman the year before.

In today\'s world, it\'s a painful reminder of what happens when badly misread cultural trends, aging showbiz producers and a full committee of writers collide on-screen. Visually it\'s a day-glow disaster, combining recklessly outlandish wardrobe, distractingly obvious matte-painting backdrops, startlingly grotesque makeup effects and an odd mix of kids\' primary colors with ink-black noir lighting. The cast is so stale, weak and one-dimensional throughout that not even an A-list staff of Hollywood\'s elite is able to play life preserver: Dustin Hoffman, James Caan and Al Pacino are lost amidst the flood of stilted dialog, Madonna sleepwalks through a rotten performance as, basically, herself, and Warren Beatty is so squeaky clean and unrelentingly straightforward in the leading role that it almost works on a purely satirical level. Clearly someone, somewhere, saw the runaway success of Tim Burton\'s Batman around the corner and chose to grant a similar treatment to a character they recalled from the funny pages of their own youth, without stopping to consider if Tracy\'s story was as relevant and trans-generational as Bruce Wayne\'s. The splashy colors and simple, hackneyed plot make it a no-sell to adults, while the abundance of sex and violence also makes it tough to buy as a kid\'s movie.

The cast is solid all around - Beatty, Pacino, Madonna, Glen Headly, Dustin Hoffman, William Forsythe, R.G. Armstrong, Charles Durning, Seymour Cassel, Mandy Patinkin, Paul Sorvino and Dick van Dyke. James Caan shows up in a great cameo as a bitter rival of Pacino\'s, plus Estelle Parsons is there as well and I was surprised to see Kathy Bates in a blink-and-miss bit part.\n\nMany people dislike this one because it is \'cheesy\'. I will admit that its sense of perfect good against complete evil is old-fashioned but it is based on a comic strip which originated in the crime-ridden 1930s, after all. For what it is, it is decent entertainment. The plot starts to come unravelled in the third act, since the storyline with \"The Blank\" and the twist about his identity makes little sense. A lot of footage Beatty had shot could not find its way in the theatres, maybe it contributed towards making the twist clearer. If the footage exists I would like to see a Director\'s cut some time. The film also features some excellent montages mostly set to songs.\n\nBeatty is alright in the role, a bit stiff, but his character is of a one-dimensional good guy so I guess he couldn\'t do much. Charlie Korsmo does a decent job as well, there is a very nice emotional scene with both of them towards the climax, which was a surprising change from the tongue-in-cheek mood of the film till that point. Al Pacino as Big Boy Caprice has the best role in the film, and he pantomimes his way through it in truly theatrical style. He is like a powder keg and goes completely bonkers in the end in spectacular fashion. Dustin Hoffman is also hilarious as Mumbles, I wish there were more scenes with him, his role in Big Boy\'s gang is not defined at all.

There\'s so much to look at you can forgive the simplistic plot.\n\nSadly there are other problems. Way too many villains--they try and fit in all of Tracys\' villains from the comic strip. There are too many and it amounts to overkill. Beatty is pretty bad as Tracy--stonefaced and not projecting any emotion or feeling--not good. Madonna is--of course--terrible as Breathless (but she DOES look good in those dresses and really belts out the songs).

While there are certain superficial similarities to the Burton helmed production, the fact that the two films were in production roughly around the same time hints more at coincidence.\n\nThe movie spiritually speaking has much more in common with Brian de Palma\'s The Untouchables adaptation than 1989\'s Batman. From the straight arrow protagonist to the over the top villain played by an actor from The Godfather (Al Pacino being this movie Robert de Niro) the movie is clearly trying to ape that particular framework while filtering it through the lens of a comic book art style. The movie is absolutely gorgeous to look at. From the make up, to the costumes, to the city itself, the movie takes a very stylized approach to its material with a color pallet inspired by the aesthetics of 1930s newspaper comic strips and a noticeable absence of earthy or industrial colors that give the sets a uniquely artificial look that\'s visual interesting. In many ways its usage of make up and set design is reminiscent of Robert Altman\'s usage when he made his adaptation of Popeye in 1980. But unfortunately the movie beneath its beautiful costumes, sets, and makeup is hollow and lacking in substance.\n\nThe biggest issue with Dick Tracy is that despite an over the top design, everything is played very flatly (with the exception of one or two characters) Dick Tracy is a standard no nonsense cop (sort of Elliot Ness run through a funhouse mirror of exaggeration of his \"untouchable\" moniker), he has a standard love interest and a standard kid sidekick and none of the main characters in this movie feel memorable or engaging. Al Pacino appears to be having fun at least as the villain Big Boy, but a little of him goes a long way and his performance loses its novelty quickly (the fact Pacino got an Oscar nomination for this performance feels almost like a joke), Madonna is decent playing an exaggerated femme fatale, Breathless Mahoney, but like all the other roles in the movie it\'s a flat role that\'s only barely elevated by its performance.\n\nDick Tracy isn\'t a bad movie and it clearly has ambition and craft at work, but it\'s also in the shadow of other comic book movies. It doesn\'t have the heart and character of something like Popeye, nor does it have the excess and camp appeal of something like Flash Gordon.

It\'s a really great film, super-funny, super-entertaining, but also with a great heart and a very interesting human exploration of the condition of elderly people. It is also very very tender. The writer/director was inspired by his grandma, and you get this love and tenderness towards the limtis and conditions of the elderly people. The action dimension is funny but realistic, and is played in reference and contrast to the Tom Cruise Mission Impossible franchise. I would say a Mission Impossible with a 93 unstoppable protagonist. Great acting, I liked especially Fred Hechinger, the grandson, and obviusly June Squibb, which ia absolutely great. Not surprised if June Squibb gets a nomination to the Oscars, or the Oscar itself.\n22 out of 24 found this helpful. Was this review helpful?

A feel-good comedy clocking in at an hour and a half. No big action scenes, no CGI, no superheroes, no T&A, and ABSOLUTELY NO POLITICS. Pretty much the bane of modern audiences, but that\'s just fine because modern audiences have no taste.\n\nThe movie follows Thelma, a 93 year old woman who is conned out of some money. When she won\'t let it go, her family starts to worry about her living on her own, but her grandson has her back. She sets out to get what\'s hers, but instead of shooting a bunch of stupid action scenes with old people doing wirework pretending to do kung-fu, it keeps everything within the realities of what a 93 year old can do. The scenes presented as action scenes are done so for comedic effect. June Squibb and Richard Rountree (RIP) were great, Fred Hechinger reminds me sooo much of Joaquin Phoenix (which is a good thing), and Clark Gregg/Parker Posey are always good. I\'m struggling to find anything negative to say, really. Maybe a little more Malcolm McDowell?\n\nIt\'s a quick, fun movie with some creativity, and it handles the challenges that the elderly face in a modern world very tastefully.'),(512,29,'8/10','Grandma\'s Mission: Possible','ferguson-6','20 June 2024','Greetings again from the darkness. With so many senior citizens (Boomers) around these days, we should expect more movies featuring older characters, and movies that this demographic might enjoy watching. Instead, most movies treat seniors as either mostly silent set pieces in family scenes or as awkward buffoons (see the recent SUMMER CAMP, or better yet, don\'t see it). Writer-director Josh Margolin apparently understands this, and his first feature film is not just funny, it also allows a few elderly actors to lead the way.\n\nJune Squibb is not just any 94-year-old leading lady. Of course, that\'s a bit facetious, since such a list would be very short. For someone whose film and TV career didn\'t get started until she was in her 60\'s (she was on stage prior), Ms. Squibb has put together a remarkable career. She\'s been memorable in such films as NEBRASKA (where she received an Oscar nomination), BLOW THE MAN DOWN (2019), and ABOUT SCHMIDT (2002), as well as numerous TV shows along the way. Here she stars in the titular role as Thelma, and wins us over with her charm and determination.\n\nBased on a true story (there really was a Thelma that went through this), we find Thelma still living in her own house gladly accepting periodic assistance from her beloved and kind grandson Daniel (Fred Hechinger, \"The White Lotus\"). The two have a close relationship, and that\'s precisely what makes Thelma such an easy target for the clever phone scammer. She panics in her desire to quickly rescue Daniel from the legal scrape the caller informs her of, and she mails off a chunk of cash believing she\'s doing what\'s best for him. Embarrassed once she discovers the ruse, Thelma listens as her daughter Gail (Parker Posey, BEAU IS AFRAID, 2023) and son-in-law Alan (Clark Gregg, Agent Coulson in the Marvel Universe) discuss moving her into an assisted living facility. However, since she and Daniel have recently watched Tom Cruise and his daring stunts in MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE, Thelma has other ideas ... she (secretly) sets out to find the bad guys and retrieve her money.\n\nThe rest of the story revolves around Thelma\'s mission and Daniel\'s attempt to bring her home safely (and prove his own worthiness). Thelma hooks up with old (no pun intended) friend, Ben (Richard Roundtree, SHAFT, 1971) and the two set off on an exciting (mis)adventure that must be seen to appreciate. The two make a great team - sometimes bonding over humor, sometimes disagreeing about the plan ... just like real people would do. The trail finds Thelma crossing paths with another elderly gent played by Malcolm McDowell (A CLOCKWORK ORANGE, 1971), and it\'s a scene that I look forward to watching again.\n\nThe film is quite entertaining and, quite fittingly, appropriate for most ages (except for a smattering of kinda blue language). It\'s such a pleasure to see elderly characters that matter and think and react and participate in life. When Thelma says, \"I didn\'t expect to get so old\", we understand exactly what she means. The various times she proclaims, \"I think I know her\", we can relate. With a rare score that features a flute, this is not just one of the more realistic depictions of seniors we\'ve seen, filmmaker Margolin has actually delivered a case study on how to create a movie starring senior citizens that is both funny and respectful. This is one I hope many will see.\n\nMagnolia Pictures will release THELMA in select theaters on June 21, 2024.'),(513,29,'8/10','Thelma, Without Louise','xnyrnkc','21 June 2024','I just left the theater after seeing the new June Squibb film, \"Thelma\", and I walked to my car with a big smile on my face. Working with seniors daily and seeing how resilient some of them are and the stories they have to tell, made me enjoy this film even more. For June Squibb, starring in a film at age 93 (she is 94 now), was quite enjoyable. She held her own in \"Nebraska\" and received an Academy Award nomination for that role. She might get nominated again. Having been scammed by phone scammers who pretend to be her injured grandson, she gets swindled out of $10k. When she realizes her grandson is fine, she decides to go on a Tom Cruise: Mission Imposible quest, to find the culprits and retrieve her money. With the help of a friend, played by Richard Roundtree, in his last role, tags along from his nursing home with Thelma driving his scooter, heading into unsafe territory to find the culprits. It\'s a journey and I recommend everyone to go along for the ride. To reveal anymore would give away too much. The movie is tender, sincere and at times outright hilarious. And it\'s based on a true story. The supporting cast is good and believable. Some of the story and actions are a bit far fetched but the film is worth seeing and has some good dialogue about aging and not taking life for granted!'),(514,29,'9/10','\"Thelma\": An Even Better Version of Mission Impossible','jaysonpajaronvistal','22 June 2024','Over the years, action movies often cast actors/actresses who are young, agile, and flexible, creating a limitation to a vibrant genre. With \"Thelma\", the movie emerges as a refreshing and revitalizing departure from the norm regarding the action-comedy genre. From the visionary, Josh Margolin, the movie is inspired by the real-life experiences of his grandmother, \"Thelma\", reimagining the action genre by placing an elderly grandmother as the lead. The film stands as a testament to the boundless potential of storytelling, regardless of age, and is an exuberant celebration of life, family, and the indomitable will to defy expectations.\n\nJune Squibb, in her first leading role performance in 40 years, delivers a tour-de-force performance as the savage grandmother---Thelma. \"Thelma\" is a strong-willed grandmother who embarks on a series of thrilling action escapades, despite her advanced age of 93, Squibb embodies the character with such grit and determination that is palpable throughout the movie, making it an infectious and heartwarming performance. But above all, her performance is full of joy that transcends and will linger even after the credits roll. Her performance is so compelling and hilarious that it begs the question: why has Hollywood overlooked her talents for so long? Although she previously garnered an Oscar nomination for her performance in \"Nebraska\", her performance in \"Thelma\" undoubtedly deserves another nod, and this time in a leading role nomination. However, given the film\'s indie comedy label, one might worry that the Academy could overlook her extraordinary performance once again.\n\nThe film opens with \"Thelma\" living a seemingly mundane life, overshadowed by the well-meaning but overbearing concerns of her daughter, \"Gail\", son-in-law Alan, and grandson Danny. Not long enough, the audience are being whisked away on a roller-coaster adventure that reveals Thelma\'s hidden prowess and invincible spirit. Margolin\'s direction and vision are both deft and literate, employing familiar action tropes, like Mission Impossible, in a manner that is both age-appropriate and hilariously innovative. Whether it\'s Thelma outsmarting a group of bumbling burglars or executing a high-stake heist to retrieve a stolen family heirloom, the film never ceases to surprise and entertain audiences with its rich and hilarious storytelling.\n\nThe film\'s greatest strength lies in the film\'s ability to balance humor with heartfelt and action-packed moments. Margolin\'s screenplay is infused with a natural, infectious humor that feels genuine and respectful. The comedy aspect of the film arises naturally from the characters and situations, allowing the audience to laugh alongside Thelma rather than at her. This kind of inclusive approach to humor is what makes the film so endearing and relatable, Thelma\'s antics are not just funny, but also a celebration of her agency and vitality, serving as a poignant reminder that life doesn\'t stop at a certain age, or in this case, at 93.\n\nAt its core, \"Thelma\" is a family movie. Amid the high-octane action sequences and clever comedic scenes, the film delves into the profound bonds and intricate dynamics that define familial relationships. Margolin captures the heart of the movie through its tender and intimate moments that will resonate with authenticity and ingenuity. Even the interactions between Thelma and her family are imbued with genuine emotions and reflect the love, frustration, and unspoken understanding that often characterize real-life family dynamics. Even as the credit rolls, the film will leave its audiences to ponder and reflect, and in my case, cry.\n\nThe film\'s emotional impact is matched by its exciting roller-coaster pacing. One moment, you\'re laughing out loud, and the next, you\'re reaching for tissues---moments like these make \"Thelma\" a truly engaging and immersive experience. The film\'s wholesomeness and heart-touching tribute make it a perfect addition to the ever-evolving cinematic universe, one that can be enjoyed by everyone, from kids to grandparents. It\'s the kind of film that is universally appealing and can be enjoyed together with your friends, family, and especially your grandparents. The film\'s charm lies in its ability to entertain while also delivering a heartfelt message about the value of family and life.\n\nIn conclusion, \"Thelma\" is a cinematic gem that deserves to be celebrated and talked about. Squibb\'s captivating performance is phenomenal and heartbreaking at the same time, together with Margolin\'s direction that breathes new life into the action-comedy genre with clever humor, heartfelt moments, and a fresh perspective. The film\'s ability to tackle themes of aging, agency, and family with such grace and authenticity is what the film stand out sets apart from other action-comedy flicks. Thelma is the kind of film that will make you laugh out loud and bring you to tears, and after its credit rolls, you will have a new perspective and appreciation of the resilience and strength of the human spirit regardless of your age. \"Thelma\" stands out as one of the most entertaining and heartfelt films in recent years, a testament to the idea that heroes come in all shapes, sizes, and ages and that life\'s adventures come with no expiration date. Whether you\'re a fan of action, comedy, or great storytelling, \"Thelma\" is a must-watch. It\'s a film that defies expectations and will leave a long-lasting impression on its audiences.'),(515,29,'7/10','Fun and delightful movie','chenp-54708','29 January 2024','Watched this at the 2024 Sundance Film Festival.\n\n\"Thelma\" isn\'t perfect but as a whole, it is a fun and entertaining movie about the lives of elderly people, issues of scam calls and family with fun energy, good direction and a wonderful performance from June Squibb. Director Josh Margolin does a pretty good job on blending comedic and dramatic elements together into the narrative with good humor, fun characters and interesting dynamics between the characters. Squibb\'s character was highly entertaining to observe and while the other characters were okay, I found each of the characters to have some decent chemistry and energy together.\n\nThe production is solid, the camerawork is okay, and the dialogue is pretty good, while some moments could be better. Margolin has a lot of fun references to Tom Cruise\'s Mission Impossible and he was able to add the jokes and references well into the narrative and action that is occurring in the movie. Although I did found the ending to be slightly anticlimactic and a little unrealistic, as a whole, the heart in the movie is strong and Margolin clearly put a lot of passionate into this project.\n\nFun movie to watch with friends and it really is sweet.'),(516,29,'9/10','Don\'t Mess with the Old Lady','brentsbulletinboard','22 June 2024','According to playwright David Mamet, \"Age and treachery will always beat youth and exuberance.\" And, if 93-year-old Thelma Post (June Squibb) has anything to say about it in this fact-based action-comedy-drama, you can take that notion to the bank. In this story of a spry but sometimes-gullible widowed retiree living on her own, we watch - often in jaw-dropping awe - a feisty, independently minded senior determined to get her money back when she\'s scammed out of her funds in a phone-based phishing scheme. Thelma says nothing about her plan to her family (Fred Hechinger, Parker Posey, Clark Gregg), who are already concerned about her ability to continue living on her own, and recruits the assistance of a wily old friend (Richard Roundtree) to join her in her quest to retrieve the stolen cash. The result is an uproarious farce featuring humor that\'s clearly outlandish but never implausible or over the top. But there\'s more to this offering than laughs - the sight of capable, underestimated elderly folks taking charge over their lives (and, in the case of this picture, even performing their own stunts!) is truly inspiring. This is backed by a potent, poignant (though never preachy) underlying look at what it\'s like to grow old and the losses that come with it, a bittersweet meditation on the inevitable changes that come with age and how all too quickly they arrive, material that\'s deftly and often philosophically interwoven with the comedy. Director Josh Margolin\'s debut feature represents an impressive premiere for the writer-actor, featuring a superbly penned, well-balanced, evenly paced script relating the experiences of his own 103-year-old grandmother, who\'s still alive and kicking and whose real-life home was used as one of the film\'s principal movie sets. It\'s also a triumph for 94-year-old Squibb in her career\'s first-ever lead role, one worthy of Oscar contention that effectively depicts a wide-ranging talent that\'s been bottled up for far too long. And the film is a fine showcase for Roundtree in his final feature film performance, one in which we see him in a different light from many of his previous roles and in which he\'s perfectly matched with his cunning co-star. My only issue with the picture is with the portrayal of Thelma\'s family, in which the development of its three principals never comes off quite right, seemingly reaching for something that doesn\'t gel properly, an aspect of the narrative that clearly could have used some further refinement. Otherwise, though, \"Thelma\" (or \"Thelmaf\" as it was known in an alternate version of the title) is one of the funniest, best produced releases that I\'ve seen in quite some time. So hop on your scooter and get your behind to see this one - or else.'),(517,29,'7/10','A cute little movie','truejoo','22 June 2024','Who knew we needed a noir film about a 90 year old protagonist? June Squib plays Thelma a 90 year old grandmother who\'s just lost her money to a phone scam. When neither the police nor her family offer much help she decides to take matters into her own hands with the help of her old a friend Ben played by Roundtree.\n\nThelma is particularly strong when exploring the limitations and meaning of aging. Throughout the film our protagonist is confronted with her limitation in suspenseful and hilarious ways. A big part of the joke is that the mundane everyday tasks, feel like a dangerous action movie sequence for a 90 year old. The film revisits this joke successfully and often.\n\nWhen the movie isn\'t playing geriatric Mission Impossible, we see how much the younger family cares for their grandmother. The director really did a good job of capturing the uncomfortable challenge of caring for an elderly loved one while still respecting their independence.\n\nOverall, I\'d recommend the movie. It\'s cute and sometimes sweet. It\'s funny, but I wasn\'t rolling in the isles.\n\n7/10.'),(518,29,'8/10','Hilarious and Heartfelt','jaredkjacoby','23 June 2024','A 93-year-old woman living alone is scammed by a caller pretending to be her grandson who steals $10,000 from her. In spite of the concerns from her family, Thelma Post goes on an adventure to get her money back. She gets the help from her reluctant friend Ben to find and confront her swindlers.\n\nThelma is a movie excels at comedic timing. There are a lot of gags in this movie, some witty dialogue, some physical, a couple running gags and a lot about the situations older people are in. Nearly all of them land. I was laughing as hard as I did in Bad Boys: Ride or Die and the people I was with laughed throughout the film too. While there may have been a joke or two that did not work for me, I would say I laughed about every five minutes with this film. The best part about this movie is the timing of the jokes too and they never come across as mean-spirited or mocking elderly people. I think that people of all ages can find something humorous in this action-comedy flick.\n\nThe story is not about the capabilities of a senior citizens and how you do not have to let anyone take advantage of you. In this movie, Thelma handles herself very well and pushes herself to catch the thieves that swindled her. She is shown to be very resilient and refuses to let her weaknesses stop her from getting her money back. However, the movie is also about not tackling dangerous situations alone. Thelma is very resilient, but there are times she does need help on her quest and she learns throughout the film. The message comes across as knowing when you need an extra hand in difficult situations. The script handles the themes in this movie beautifully and it comes off as encouraging and uplifting.\n\nThelma Post is a great protagonist. She is funny, she is lovable and kind and she is one of the most resilient people I have seen in a while. She does not let anything or anyone stop her. There is one moment in the film that I cheered on the inside from her. Thelma is flawed in that she can be selfish and few times, but she is shown to have her heart in the right place and admit when she was wrong. June Squibb is terrific in the role. She is funny, charming and has fantastic expressions and comedic timing. Thelma Post as a character could not work nearly as well without Squibb\'s enthusiasm and wit.\n\nThe supporting cast is strong too with the late Richard Roundtree as a standout as Ben. Roundtree plays as Thelma\'s cautious and helpful friend beautifully and shares very fun chemistry with June Squibb. This is one of those movies where I could tell the two stars seemed like friends in real life. Thelma\'s family is very likable and concerned, but I am not sure how to feel about the rant from the grandson. I could see that scene being relatable to a degree because it is dealing with a missing person and he feels as if his grandmother\'s disappearance is his fault, but it is a bit tough to watch, especially when he rants in front of his parents. Fred Hinchinger\'s acting in that scene works well because he is relatively calm most of the movies and then he lets that out of nowhere. Malcolm McDowell is in the movie and he is great here. The cast is really good and everyone contributes to the plot.\n\nAs I said earlier, Thelma is not a typical action movie in the slightest. The movie is more about the adventure of Thelma and Ben than a film with chases or action scenes. It\'s another part of the film that makes it more charming because it still finds ways to make the story tense by showing how dangerous this seemingly simple journey for Thelma can be. One of my favorite scenes though is the scooter chase in the nursing home. It is such a creative and entertaining sequence. The climax is fantastic in the buildup and payoff with how far Thelma has come. The cinematography by David Bolen is solid, but the editing by Magolin is what makes this movie so dynamic. The film is edited in a way that builds up the tension and comedic beats at the perfect time. The musical score by Nick Chuba is really good and it fits the tone of the movie.\n\nI really enjoyed Thelma. This is the perfect mix of funny, heartwarming and intense moments. It is also surprisingly original as an action movie. This is a movie that takes full advantage of its premise from start to finish. It encourages older people that they still have their lives to live. This is one of the funniest movies I have seen in a while and it had a few moments that I found pretty touching.

Squibb and the late Roundtree are excellent and Posey and Clark were perfectly annoying. The grandson was wonderful as the ineffectual but caring and sensitive epitome of millennials.

It also had a decent character villain in Malcom McDowell, which justifies my perception of it. I mean it has the prefect action premise: \"They stole her money now she has to get it back!\" It\'s funny how because the cast was old as dirt it made a lot of things, they were doing far more suspenseful: walking upstairs, riding a moped, falling. I do feel like you got to be the right age to feel the danger and be able to laugh at it. If I was 30 to 40 years older I possible think this was a horror flick.\n\nSo yeah, it was a delightful film about what grandma means to everyone when they get old enough to need to worry about them more than usually. A bit grim if you are coming to that age when you are a burden to one\'s family.

It\'s really June Squibb, who is delightful and serious and bewildered and sad and yet still has her \"good\" days and, thankfully, the one she\'s on to get her 10k back is one of those, and Roundtree is such a powerful force here, so empathetic but also the buddy Thelma needs to tell her to not do *that* or to slow down or etc.\n\nWhile I wished Roundtree was still with us, it\'s hard to ask for a better movie to close a 55+ year career on than this, and we can tell he\'s having the time of his life in the role, and with it as much as Shaft or anything else he\'d done. He has great chemistry with Squibb, and he knows how to time just the right look of conservation with a mix of \"yeah, well, let\'s do it.\"\n\nPosey and Clark are having fun as well, though they\'re saddled with fairly one dimensional roles where the sitcom-ish side of this comes through. I liked the grandson better as a guy at 24, who is (and I could relate as I was like this till... what\'s my age again) trying to figure himself out and the one thing he knows is he\'s gotta take care of his grandmother.\n\nThe \"wandering off to the salad bar for another helping\" is a potent analogy: if there was just doddering wandering without any idea, that\'s one thing; Thelma has a good idea of what she needs to do (again, a \"good\" day), albeit with the stubbornness of \"I don\'t need my family\'s help\" (or that she knows how fussy they are about it), and that\'s the joy in the movie is to see a proactive and commanding character, despite if she is mostly riding a scooter, we catch our breath if she falls down, and unintentionally uploading pictures to her Instagram (who hasn\'t?)\n\nSo, not a top 10 of the year sort of flick, but it\'s perfectly fine being a hit as a single that becomes a double.

Richard Roundtree, however, is someone you can trust to pick you up if you fall, and adds even greater dignity to a film about the indignity of slowly fading away into a hospital bed.\n\nAlthough the funniest and most poignant moments might hit squarely only for those of us so fortunate to have seen loved ones live long enough to enjoy a life diminished in both physical and mental prowess, we can all enjoy the daring adventure of Thelma, who has always had great respect for running errands.\n\nThere are plenty of forced ironies but most of them work cleverly. Unfortunately, the fun feels like a drag even at the fairly unusual runtime below 100 minutes. Some of the extra fat could have been chopped around the wholly unnecessary side plot related to Thelma\'s grandson\'s love life, as well as the fairly unfunny and on-the-nose jabs about helicopter parenting.

Thelma (June Squibb at 93 years old) in the current titular action/comedy tries to help her grandson Danny (Fred Hechinger) in need of being bailed out of trouble, so the scammers say. Sending them cash was not just a bad move; it also revealed the electronic vulnerability of the elderly.\n\nJosh Margolin, in his debut as a director and the writer who recollects his aging grandmother, has a firm hand on the whimsical adventure as Thelma tracks down the crooks while keeping her dignity and avoiding the cliches of the old-folks drama. We know she\'s already had a brain tumor, sepsis, edema, hip replacement, double mastectomy, and valve replacement, but we also know she\'s a survivor, leaving her family less able to handle her aging\'s infirmity than she.\n\nMargolin gives her no heroic speeches but rather shows by using mostly her point of view a human being of sweet, even temper not ready to give in to the grim reaper.

It\'s fun, sweet and something that people of all ages can really enjoy. In a year that\'s already had some strong choices, Thelma is one of the best comedies of 2024.

The depiction of arena deaths fell disappointingly flat, lacking the visceral impact that defined the franchise. Moreover, the CGI work was subpar, failing to immerse the audience effectively.\n\nHowever, the film wasn\'t without its merits. A standout feature was the commendable ensemble cast, with each actor bringing a nuanced performance. Yet, some talents were sadly underutilized, leaving viewers wanting more from characters who had the potential for greater depth and development.\n\nOne major flaw that overshadowed the positives was the rushed pacing of the narrative. The movie struggled to explore the intricacies of its intriguing concept thoroughly. A more deliberate approach, possibly as a two-part installment, could have allowed for a more immersive and satisfying exploration of the dystopian world.\n\nDespite its shortcomings, the film managed to maintain a semblance of the franchise\'s essence.

Backstory to snow is fine if it adds something new to the universe, however nothing new is added here, we get taught everything we knew about the world and get tiny little snips of backstory of the origins of the Hunger Games. For the movies insane long run time, the final act of this film seems like a race to get to the end of the story. The slow paced world building it creates in the first two acts is immediately thrown out for the purpose of reaching that finish line. Unlike the last Hunger Games movies being split into two, this is the Hunger Games movie that should have been split into two. We don\'t get to the motivations and reasonings behind characters other than a line or two then we arrive at them. Another hour and a half of story telling could have fleshed these characters out and made the ending more meaningful. However we\'re left with a film that doesn\'t seem to ever end, masked with good acting, set design and great cinematography.

Then I saw it was released, and just decided to go see because why not. I hadn\'t seen any trailers and knew nothing about it, just that it was based on a new book by Suzanne Collins.\n\nI had absolutely zero expectations, although the cynical part of me thought I might be wasting my time, especially after seeing the runtime on the movie. However, 3 hours later I can admit I left the cinema feeling rather impressed. I genuinely enjoyed it.\n\nWhile the hunger games trilogy we know with Katniss Everdeen strike me as a fun, rewatchable teen-fantasy, in the Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes, we see a much darker and grittier side of the world of Panem, which I felt resulted in experiencing a much more horrifying reality of the games themselves. It felt more real, and grounded, and loved seeing how everything operated with far more inferior technology and fewer established rules.\n\nSince watching the movie I\'ve seen criticism of the characters and acting, and while I am usually quite strict on that kind of thing too, I genuinely see their points here. I understand Rachel Zegler is an actress of controversy for a lot of people, I myself have seen a lot of debatable interviews with her, but I believe she shows of her talent here with a great performance. The standout performance is definitely Tom Blyth and a young president Snow however, an actor who I have not seen in anything else before. I found myself genuinely caring about the fate of the two characters and their relationship, which is a hard thing to achieve, and i feel is the core element of this movie, therefore really enjoyed because of it. The supporting characters were also well performed, such as Peter Dinklage and Viola Davis.\n\nThe movie is split into three chapters, like a book. Chapters 1 and 2 are certainly the stronger of the three, which I very much enjoyed for reasons already stated. Despite still enjoying chapter 3, and completely recognising it\'s importance, I feel as though it was slightly rushed, and therefore perhaps would be understood more by people who have read the book and have pre-existing knowledge of the hunger games.\n\nAlthough certainly not a flawless movie, I am pleasantly surprised by it and had a fun time watching.

First of all, the timing and momentum of the movie are too slow, and the acting is not on par with that of the original series\' cast. While the original movies had a lot of fine acting and characters that I cared deeply about, I did not relate to any of the characters in The Ballad. The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes is not a total disaster, but it is mediocre at best, with some parts being too lengthy and others too short. Having read the original books and being mostly satisfied with both the books and the movie adaptations (despite their flaws), I cannot say whether the mess in storytelling is due to the book or just the movie\'s script, as I have not read The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes. Also Songbirds & Snakes reminds me of that bad last Star Wars trilogy - they copied everything from the original source but failed to catch the soul, charm and grandeur entirely, everything just felt formulaic, even dead.\n209 out of 304 found this helpful.

Lou, a cautious gym manager, has her world turned upside down when she develops feelings for Jackie, a dedicated bodybuilder in Las Vegas training for a competition (Katie O\'Brian). Sparks fly, but their budding romance gets entangled with Lou\'s dark family secrets, propelling them down a violent path.\n\nLove Lies Bleeding isn\'t afraid to push boundaries. It evokes memories of classic thrillers like Body Double, with its neon-drenched aesthetic and underlying themes of obsession and desire. However, Glass injects a contemporary dose of female empowerment, subverting the stereotypical femme fatale trope. Jackie isn\'t just a damsel in distress; she\'s a complex character with her own agency, which adds a layer of intrigue to the narrative.\n\nThe film\'s greatest strength lies in its central performances. Stewart delivers a raw and intense portrayal of Lou, a woman yearning for connection but burdened by her past. O\'Brian matches her intensity, embodying the steely determination and vulnerability of Jackie with remarkable nuance. Their chemistry is undeniable, making us invested in their tumultuous relationship, even as things spiral out of control.\n\nWhile the plot takes some wild turns, it\'s the film\'s thematic exploration that lingers. Glass dissects the destructive nature of desire, and the lengths people go to in the name of love-or perhaps, obsession. The violence, though brutal, feels purposeful, serving as a metaphor for the emotional turmoil the characters endure.\n\nAdmittedly, the pacing can be uneven at times. The first act establishes the characters and their connection beautifully, but the middle section drags a bit as the focus shifts towards the criminal underbelly. However, the film regains its momentum in the final act, culminating in a climax that\'s both shocking and strangely cathartic.\n\nTechnically, Love Lies Bleeding is a knockout. The cinematography is sharp, using bold colours and contrasting lighting to create a visually arresting world. The pounding score complements the film\'s intensity, while the editing keeps the narrative taut without sacrificing character development.\n\nLove Lies Bleeding isn\'t for the faint of heart. It\'s a film that revels in its own darkness, challenging us with its graphic violence and unconventional love story. But for those seeking a neo-noir experience that\'s both thrilling and thought-provoking, this is a film that will stay with you long after the credits roll.\n\nLove Lies Bleeding is a film with flaws, but its bold direction, phenomenal performances, and exploration of complex themes make it a worthwhile watch, especially for fans of unconventional thrillers.

With a dash of crime family drama.\n\nI found the cinematography of the movies to be quite impressive; it had a captivating aesthetic. Although it\'s not on an epic scale and mostly unfolds in remote settings, it\'s mesmerizingly filmed with themes of sex and violence. The characters are pretty good, so were the actors playing them. Kristen Stewart was Kristen Stewart, I think you already know what to expect when you see her in a movie, and I think she was pretty good.

I just didn\'t watch any trailers or anything and went in blind. It also included some other adult/mature content like domestic violence. It\'s quite gory as well. Initially, it felt like it was penned by a man; I was surprised to learn it was written/directed by a woman afterward. I recall thinking that there will probably be a lot of people commenting on this, expressing their displeasure with how women are portrayed in movies written by men.\n\nThe movie had several moments where I thought to myself, well that\'s taken a weird turn. It gets more weird and weirder the longer in goes. It\'s really weird that it was common/normal back then to just hit your wife. It was jarring to watch. Franco\'s character is probably the worst one.\n\nIt\'s also one of those movies where none of the characters are good people, it\'s just bad people making bad decisions, in the name of love. I didn\'t really find myself rooting for anyone and l didn\'t feel particularly attached to the movie as a whole. I feel like it could\'ve been better, and by better I mean more psychedelic, more violent, maybe even disturbing. It\'s not a movie for everyone, but it\'s pretty interesting and I enjoyed it.

It unashamedly - proudly, even - takes the often explicitly cishet, masculine revenge/crime-gone-wrong genre and tells it from a distinctly LGBT+, feminine angle that doesn\'t feel exploitative despite its graphic nature. It also doesn\'t box itself in with that \'feminine\' label, allowing its female characters to exist with all the complexities and imperfections usually afforded to their male counterparts. It\'s refreshing to see a story like this be told from a creative team of primarily women, and director Rose Glass continues to impress with her sophomore feature. Filled with palpable texture and peppered with moments of stark surrealism, the feature typically avoids convention despite telling a fairly conventional tale. It\'s the kind of film you can almost smell, a dirty and down-to-earth representation of small-town America that\'s the opposite of \'Hollywood\' (whatever that term is typically associated with). Its moments of shocking violence punctuate the interpersonal drama at its core and inherently raise its stakes. Kristen Stewart is really good a Lou, with a non-showy performance that feels tactile and real. She\'s able to hide a real darkness just beneath her shy yet brash exterior, and her initially meek interactions with Katy O\'Brian believably bubble into the full-blown immersion associated with head-over-heels love. O\'Brian turns in similarly impressive work, portraying a dangerous but vulnerable person whose inner life is layered and messy and likely not all that much more stable prior to her experiments with steroids. She\'s so ripped she could easily play She-Hulk without the aid of CGI (which, incidentally, I\'d love to see), but it isn\'t her stunning physique that leaves the strongest impression and that\'s no easy feat. The supporting cast do a good job at making the world feel palpable, with Ed Harris\' hair extensions always threatening to outact everyone they share a frame with (Harris himself is good too, of course) and Dave Franco channeling his brother to convincingly play a real creep (and somehow garner a hint of sympathy with a single word in his most memorable scene). Although it\'s not always as exciting or intense as I\'d like, the piece has a strong atmosphere throughout and its world really does feel tangible. Its complex characters constantly reveal darker and darker aspects of themselves, all while its heroes fall deeper and deeper into an all consuming romance that might just doom them both. Its infrequent violence is as shocking as it is affecting, and its confident surrealism gives it a slightly ambiguous air that adds to its overall effect. It\'s a strong example of female and LGBT+ representation, too. It\'s not as good as Glass\' previous picture, \'Saint Maude (2019)\', but it\'s a really solid follow-up that\'s effective pretty much across the board.'),(553,31,'6/10','A pulsating romance thriller','spencermcook','21 January 2024','\"Love Lies Bleeding\" is endlessly thrilling, unapologetically gruesome, and potently lustful in its perception of love, or in this case, more so in the idea of attachment. Rose Glass immediately develops an identity on a pulsating energy that intensifies as secrets begin to unravel and intertwine with one another, paired with a score that\'ll find its way beneath your skin. The visual details are addictive. From extreme close up shots enhanced by an accurate, yet sometimes uncomfortable sound design, to a dark red color palette and slower frames of movement to provoke darkness and uneasiness. Due to timely humor and several montage sequences, there\'s a lighthearted disguise that masks the severity of how exaggerated and ambitious this story actually is. Whether this works or doesn\'t work is for you to decide, but regardless of how you feel about the story collectively, I\'m confident that there\'s a refreshing surprise for everyone to experience.\n53 out of 105 found this helpful.

Plus, of course, Ed Harris delivers another fantastic performance.\n\nIn spite of these things, the people behind me are chatting and I\'m sitting here in the theater writing this. Bottom line is: the writing is bad. Even though it\'s a cool story, a lot of the characters\' behaviors are nonsensical, and the dialogue is just weird, which really takes the audience out of it.\n\nPlus the romantic story arc I think undermines some of the other cool elements of the film-like the world building and strong female leads. In spite of the action and strength the characters portray, it is the love arc that seems very unbelievable and forced, and I feel like I\'m watching fan fiction.\n\nGood music tho.'),(556,31,'8/10','Freaky crime thriller with squalid surroundings and a celestial soundtrack','PotassiumMan','23 March 2024','In the southwest in the late 1980s, a young female bodybuilder finds a new home in a small town. She comes across a young female employee at a gym whom she quickly connects with, but who turns out to be at odds with her family, a hive of degenerates. Their romance ends up being intertwined in a web of crime.\n\nKristen Stewart is quite good in this as the black sheep of the family and a determined rebel. Katy O\'Brian turns out to be the unexpected life blood of this film. Her performance is so multidimensional that the film just wouldn\'t be as good without her. She conveys curiosity, fear, rage and ultimately ecstasy in the arms of her newfound muse. Her discovery of steroids adds a nice bonus, but it\'s possible this plot thread merely unleashed a fierce beast that was always there and never had a escape valve. Dave Franco is well-deployed in a brief but seething role as a scummy hooligan. Ed Harris is effectively cold-hearted as the local kingpin who seemingly owns everything in the town and has local law enforcement in his back pocket to cover up his dirty tracks.\n\nAlthough profoundly gripping and impossible to tune out, this is definitely not for squeamish viewers. The violence here is quite ferocious. The tension is at times a turbo-charged level. It\'s been a while since a film filled me with some of that old school dread as it drew toward its climax. The soundtrack often lean on soothing New Wave beats, as if to provide some relief from the devilish storyline. At times disturbing, other times intensely atmospheric, this film offers an escape from mainstream fare. Through it all, the ending feels hard-earned and cathartic. Highly recommended to those like edgy filmmaking.'),(557,31,'5/10','The Incredible Hulk Meets Thelma and Louise ....','kikiclogwyni','22 April 2024','.... and none of them live happily ever after.\n\nThis film if full of very graphic violence and fairly graphic sex scenes. I wouldn\'t say either are gratuitous, given that sexual obsession and revenge are central themes of the film, but if you are troubled by either I would give this one a swerve.\n\nThe entire feel of this film is gritty and depressing. We first meet Kristen Stewart\'s character, Lou, with her hand down a feces-filled blocked literal loo. The pragmatist in me immediately wondered why there were no toilet plungers in this part of the American South (New Mexico). However, this was clearly intended to introduce her character as subsumed in the filthy, sweaty, steroid-fueled world of the body-builder.\n\nThe first act revolves primarily about her budding relationship with a female body-builder who is just passing through on her way to Vegas, the second act veers off into extreme violence and the third act ..... well that just get weird.\n\nIt is not to say this film was not worth seeing - it was - and the performances by the main characters gritty and compelling. But there was such limited character development that, by the end, I didn\'t really care who died (and it was odds on for a while that everyone would).\n\nMost enjoyable was the cinematography. Here this movie really stood out. The isolated locale of the gym where much of the first act takes place was juxtaposed, with all its fluorescent-lit grime, against a backdrop of gorgeous desert, star-filled skies. But the natural beauty of the surroundings only highlighted the unrelenting dreariness of the lives of the protagonists.

I found myself covering my eyes more than Saltburn at the gore, twists, and energizing perspective on FEMALE POWER. This movie is purposeful in its dialogue and shots.

Rose\'s sophomore feature is a visceral exploration of love entangled within the violent underbelly of a criminal family, set against the raw backdrop of the bodybuilding world. \"Love Lies Bleeding\" is an electrifying love story that revolves around the romance between Lou, a reclusive gym manager, and Jackie, an ambitious bodybuilder headed to Vegas to pursue her dream of becoming a bodybuilder champion. Their love story ignites violence when Lou\'s criminal family background is revealed.\n\nThe film\'s aesthetics set a visually striking tone that captivates the audience\'s attention right from the opening scene to the end credit. The opening scene alone is a testament to Glass\' exceptional vision as a filmmaker, beautifully setting up the narrative that unfolds with both tension and intrigue with sweaty and ripped camera shots. This allows the audience to be in an immersive romantic movie experience, mixing minute amount of body horror elements and action sequences but at its core, it\'s a powerful queer romantic movie that seems like only Glass can master. Following the noteworthy success of \"Saint Maud,\" Glass was undoubtedly under immense pressure to deliver a compelling follow-up.\n\nThe narrative setting of the movie is set in this sweaty gym, that not only serves as a backdrop, but as a character itself---sweaty, pulsating, and visceral. This effectively mirrors the internal turmoil that is contrary to the character\'s strong external physicality, making the gym environment a crucial element of the story. The cinematography in \"Love Lies Bleeding\" is exceptional. There are only a few films that rarely utilize camera work that vividly captures the essence of sweat, blood, and body figures, and Glass does it so well in this movie. The camera lingers on the sweat and blood of its characters, capturing the grueling reality of bodybuilding. Each frame in this sweaty gym is filled with rippling bodies and sweat which is a testament to the physicality of the film\'s setting. The close-up shots of rippling muscles and strained expressions transport viewers directly into the gym, allowing them to feel every drop of sweat and hear every breath. This choice not only enhances the narrative\'s intensity but also pays homage to 1980s bodybuilding footage, immersing the viewer fully into a world of relentless pursuit of physical perfection. There is where the film stands out, its impressive visual storytelling.\n\nThe aesthetics and production design of the movie are deliberately gritty and raw which weaves so well in the narrative thread. The production design pays homage to vintage 80s bodybuilding footage, yet it\'s filtered through a contemporary lens that feels both nostalgic and fresh. It deliberately avoids the polished and pristine look of many films for something much more gritty, sweaty, and authentic look. This element enriches the visual narrative as it provides a tangible sense of place that is at once inviting and repulsive, mirroring the complicated romance at play within the film\'s central relationship. This choice not only enhances the authenticity of the setting but also deepens the exploration of the physical and emotional demands of the characters. \"Love Lies Bleeding\" explores the complexities of love manifested in physical form.\n\nThe surprising element of this movie is the touch of body horror without resorting to exploitation, handling its gruesome and horror elements with subtlety. The film balances the elements of romance, body horror, and action meticulously, ensuring the gruesome aspects and action sequences of the movie are served without overpowering the theme of queer romance and sexual desire. This nuanced approach allows the film to delve into the darker sides of human desire without becoming gratuitous.\n\nKristen Stewart as Lou, delivers a powerhouse performance since \"Spencer.\" Coming off from her critically acclaimed and Oscar-worthy performance in \"Spencer,\" Kristen continues to prove to be one of the finest actresses of her generation. Her portrayal of Lou\'s intense, and almost instantaneous love for Jackie is compelling and profoundly convincing. Kristen\'s ability to convey emotion through minimalistic expression and subtle body movement adds a deep layer to her character without being on the nose. However, the real revelation here is Katy O\'Brien as Jackie. Katy brings a level of authenticity to the character that not only transcends to the viewers but is also believable due to her prior experience as an ex-bodybuilder. Her physicality and strength are impressive, but it\'s her vulnerability and emotional language that truly make her a standout and memorable. Katy\'s performance is a career-defining moment, showcasing her ability to embody both the physical intensity and emotional complexity required by the role. The fact that in an interview, Katy mentioned that she auditioned for the role 6 times before getting the part is insane. There is no other actress that fits the character of Jackie so well than Katy O\'Brien.\n\nAt its core, \"Love Lies Bleeding\" is a dark romance infused with action and some elements of body horror marked by a level of gruesome moments that is both shocking and fitting. The film\'s exploration of queer love story and violence is compelling, with strong performances and a directorial vision that\'s bold and clever, \"Love Lies Bleeding\" is definitely one of this year\'s strongest films. Understandably, the film\'s unique approach to romance, blended with dark humor and horror might not resonate to most audiences.\n\nIn conclusion, through its compelling narrative, stunning visuals, and exceptional performances, the film not only meets the high expectations set by Glass\'s debut but also sets new standards for what is possible in genre filmmaking. There are moments in the movie that feel jarring and the tonal shifts seem to be abrupt, but once this movie finds its people, it\'s likely to become a classic cult that will be celebrated as time goes by.'),(562,31,'9/10','A fun pulpy thriller','hayzinj','9 March 2024','I was intrigued by the trailer for this film, especially due to the cast, the tone and the fact that it was an A24 film.

Kristen, Katy, Anna, Ed and Dave all delivered on their roles. The chemistry between Kristen and Katy is top notch and gives a certain freshness to a lesbian relationship and power dynamic in film. It keeps you right on the edge and then as it starts to unravel it draws you in even more. Honestly I wish that there were more original films like this being made.\n35 out of 81 found this helpful.

The first feature film from writer-director Rose Glass was delayed almost two years due to COVID, but when SAINT MAUD hit in 2021, we knew immediately she was a filmmaker to watch. Along comes her second feature, co-written with Weronika Tofilska, and as a rare lesbian neo-noir, it\'s sexy and violent and stylishly filmed ... confirming Glass as one to follow.\n\nTo ensure that every viewer knows that glitz and glamour will not be featured, we are introduced to Lou (Kisten Stewart) as her gloved hand is elbow deep in a clogged toilet at the gym she manages. The gym is filled with sweaty bodies pumping iron, and Lou looks on mostly disinterested, save for gym rat Daisy (Anna Baryshnikov, Misha\'s daughter) who is obsessed with Lou thanks to their previous amorous interactions. Though Daisy is smitten, Lou is clearly disinterested, while being as nice as possible. As one lonely heart looking for love, Lou\'s eyes light up when she spots drifter Jackie (Katy O\'Brian, \"The Mandalorian\") working out one evening. Jackie is making her way to Las Vegas to compete in a bodybuilding competition, and she and Lou hit it off that first night.\n\nThe film is set in the late 1980\'s in some nowhere town in New Mexico, where nefarious doings are the only path to survival. In fact, the most nefarious of the bunch is Lou\'s father, Lou Sr (Ed Harris). Sporting shoulder length hair that gives him a \"Tales from the Crypt\" aura, Lou Sr runs a shooting range, while also running guns across the border, and in an unusual choice for a hobby, he collects live bugs. As the local crime lord, Lou Sr has a favorite spot for dumping the bodies of those who cross him.\n\nOne other local scumbag on display here is JJ (Dave Franco), husband to Lou\'s sister Beth (the great Jena Malone). JJ is a world class wife-beater and the source of much angst for Lou ... this despite Beth\'s constant willingness to forgive her husband, due to her fear of being alone. JJ is the lowest form of life, and when he puts Beth in the hospital, it sends Lou into emotional turmoil, which in turn forces her new lover Jackie to turn She-Hulk, and flash the dark side from her past.\n\nJust about anything that can go wrong for these folks, does. It\'s an endless stream of bad luck, bad decisions, and just plain bad; however, it\'s mesmerizing to watch. We see a four-way battle: guns versus muscles versus love versus inner-strength. Some characters get what they deserve, while others just wallow in the mess. Daisy shows she is not as ditzy as she seems once she gains leverage, yet she also proves she\'s not as clever as she thinks.\n\nThe performances here are quite fun to watch - Stewart, (especially) O\'Brian, Harris, Baryshnikov, and Malone are all superb, and bring heft to an already creative and heavy-duty story. The score from Clint Mansell is a perfect fit, and Rose Glass\'s film bears a slight tonal resemblance to the Coen Brothers\' classic BLOOD SIMPLE (1984). As in that one, the characters here often zig when we assume they will zag, and though the final act likely jumps the shark for some viewers, there is so much good here, that it prepares us for Glass\'s future visions.\n\nIn theaters beginning March 15, 2024.'),(564,31,'8/10','Thrilling, clever & sapphic','codyfernfan','17 March 2024','This movie has a great mix of gore, sex appeal, LGBT representation, some comedic/ironic/\"badass\" elements and portrayal of government corruption.

I didn\'t even know that Kristen Stewart would be in this (I didn\'t watch the trailer), but I think she\'s really suited for this kind of role. Her natural obliviousness coincides with her character\'s history of exhaustion and complacency amidst her chaotic familial and environmental challenges. Lou\'s father is brilliantly terrifying, a realistic depiction of the characters found in the modern day \"wild West\".

It spoke to me, although objectively I have to consider it only as above average.\n\nFirst off, the costumery and mis-en-scene is great. The outfits and the hairstyles (sure, also the soundtrack) were really all that makes this movie count as a period piece--other than a mention of the Berlin Wall, and I suppose the subject of (female) bodybuilding (and the drugs that entails), lending this neo-noir certain Cold War themes about power being destructive--but that was totally worth it. And the \"Nevada\" (shot in New Mexico) suburban desert buildings--besides evoking for me a sort of Southern California I look at romantically--complete the imagery for a dirty realism text in 2024(!).\n\nThe director knows how to compose scenes. Even when the writing doesn\'t quite hold up, the lines being said are just enough, the pacing is taught enough, and the photography is dynamic enough to convey the idea/emotion.\n\nWhich does bring me to the denouement: while initially jarring, I ultimately had to consider it as working. Risking intentional fallacy, I can understand a director/writer who crafts this sort of screenplay nowadays and knows that it can never end well for two starcrossed lovers caught in a crime spree under the modern U. S. criminal-justice system; so why not (as a postmodernist) just embrace the fact that this is cinema, that we want to see the happy ending, and to have fun with it? The seriousness is taken out of the plot, but for those in the theater laughing at what they consider camp--and, sure, the acting isn\'t always perfect, as the leads can\'t quite perform up to that responsibility, and Ed Harris plays a bit cartoonishly, and the \"psycho girlfriend\" character overacts (only Jena Malone really delivers a consistently good performance)--we can only surmise that they have never been caught in love with someone for whom there is a mutual, essential, inescapable danger, and that is the theme this picture surely succeeds in conveying.'),(570,32,'7/10','I hate to compare, but here I am comparing.','ghettoplex','29 April 2024','Here we are in 2024 with another revenge film.

Director Moritz Mohr delivered a movie that was rather action-packed from start to end.\n\nThe storyline in the movie was pretty straightforward, though a bit simplistic, as it was a simple revenge movie. But then again, action movies such as this doesn\'t really need a complex or cerebral narrative. Nay, you just lean back, munch on the snacks and enjoy the over-the-top action. Writers Tyler Burton Smith, Arend Remmers and Moritz Mohr put together a fast paced action flick.\n\nAnd over-the-top action is exactly what \"Boy Kills World\" is. There is an abundance of fight scenes, which I have to admit that I definitely enjoyed. It was choreographed quite nicely and executed nicely as well. So it was like watching a ballet of action and violence. And I have to say that Bill Skarsgård definitely carried the movie quite well.\n\nThe movie does have a good cast ensemble, with the likes of Bill Skarsgård, Jessica Rothe, Michelle Dockery, Brett Gelman, Yayan Ruhian, Sharlto Copley and Famke Janssen. And the acting performances in the movie were good.\n\nSomething I didn\'t really enjoy in the movie, and it was there from start to end, was the voice over done by H. Jon Benjamin to give the mute and deaf character Boy an internal voice. I grew very tired of listening to that rather quickly. But of course that is a matter of personal preference.\n\nVisually then \"Boy Kills World\" is good. The action is nicely brought to the screen in a very dynamic and adrenaline-filled manner, and the special effects look good as well. The wardrobe department also worked their magic quite well in the movie.\n\nI will say that I was rather surprised with the outcome of this movie, because I wasn\'t expecting a Bill Skarsgård movie to be that much in your face. And I have to say that I was genuinely entertained throughout the entire 111 minutes that the movie ran for.\n\nHowever, \"Boy Kills World\" hardly seems like a movie that will make it to my screen a second time, as there just isn\'t enough contents to the script to make it a movie that I will be watching a second time.\n\nMy rating of \"Boy Kills World\" lands on a well-deserved seven out of ten stars.'),(575,32,'6/10','Blood Drenched, Hyper Violent, Intense Action Pic That Plays More Like a Rated M Video Game Than a Film','RightOnDaddio','23 April 2024','It\'s called Boy Kills World, not Boy Meets World.

Like all the best action comedies, the zany humour disguises the beating heart at the centre.\n\nBill Skarsgård proves he doesn\'t need dialogue to communicate. He can do so much with just his eyes and the fact that it all syncs up really well with H. Jon Benjamin\'s suitably over the top voice over is just a bonus. Plus he has an adorable rapport with Quinn Copeland. Andrew Koji isn\'t given a chance to show off his physical prowess but is given the time to show how surprisingly great he is at comedy.\n\nMortiz Mohr\'s direction nails the balance between self awareness and sincerity, translating some of the language of video games to cinema effectively. With cinematography by Peter Matjasko, the camera moves with the action rather than against it. It\'s always fluid and bloody inventive, saving the best fight for last.

I\'d never read any of Tolkien\'s books when I saw the film for the first time at the theatre and, now that I\'ve read them, in retrospect I think being a neophyte to the mythology made my LOTR movie experience all the more miraculous.\n\nI loved The Two Towers and Return of the King almost as much as FOTR, but not quite, because seeing Fellowship for the first time was like taking a journey to a fabulous new place and meeting incredible new friends that you don\'t want to leave. I\'ve never felt anything quite like what this epic evoked in me. It was akin to being a child again, with that tireless sense of wonder and enjoyment of each and every moment, maybe because as a child you are discovering your surroundings, and whatever age you are, when you watch the Fellowship of the Ring you are rendered in awe upon being introduced to the purity and beauty of Middle Earth and darkly enthralled by the majesty of Eisengard, Saruman, Sauron and all of their mighty malice. One of the things that makes this movie so special (and there are so many!) is that you fall in love not only with the \"good\" characters, but also with the \"evil\" ones. For example, Christopher Lee was amazing as Saruman, and I can\'t imagine the movie without him.\n\nSome films that might be comparable to the Lord of the Rings trilogy are: The Fifth Element, the Star Wars Trilogy parts IV, V and VI (forget the newer prequels), the Matrix trilogy (especially the first part), Interview with a Vampire, the Legend of Sleepy Hollow (with Johnny Depp), Logan\'s Run and The Island. They are all excellent movies and works of art that weave that movie magic that keeps you spellbound and entranced for the duration of their runtime.\n\nBut after seeing The Fellowship of the Ring, I knew I had found the movie by which I would judge all other movies. Based on J.R.R. Tolkien\'s beloved books, Peter Jackson has set a new standard in the industry of cinema, one that I honestly think has not and won\'t be surpassed, at least not in my lifetime, not even by PJ himself.\n\nIt is truly an instant classic that will stand the test of time and be loved by generations to come.

The fact that every single sword used by the main characters was made by hand, with extra ones made only for carrying, fighting, etc, then there\'s the costumes/armor/props all made by teams of many people. They even made artificial trees for gods sake. But really all those things are just extras, what really makes this a unique watch is that it really does feel huge and sweeping, the sense of scale is fantastic and I can\'t think of anything that even comes close to matching it. What every epic flick needs this has, the cast is great, it\'s exciting, it has bags of character, it\'s funny, sad, superbly well made, with a great score and plenty of action.

Ian McKellen\'s portrayal of Gandalf is nothing short of awe-inspiring, and Elijah Wood\'s Frodo is one of the most unexpectedly captivating performances I\'ve seen in a long time. The despair, terror, and determination of the Fellowship is all there, in spades.

The second and third movies were almost entirely Frodo and his allies\' long journey, but the first half of this movie also gives a good bit of interesting introductory material including a number of scenes at the Shire, before the long adventure starts. If you watch all three of these films consecutively the action wears you down by midway through the final episode and it almost becomes just too much That never gets a chance to happen with the \"Fellowship\" film.\n\nAnyway, \"Fellowship,\" stunned me for the visuals alone.

For the record, I\'m 25 years old, and I\'ve read \"The Lord of the Rings\" in three times for the first time when I was six or seven years old. Ever since then, I read it at least once or twice a year - therefore you can count me as a fan, for I follow the same cult fan procedure with \"The Hobbit\" and \"The Silmarillion\" as well. Now onto the movie... Gosh, I saw it more than one time, and I keep wanting more of it. It just never gets boring! I really enjoyed the little stuff that is found throughout the movie for fans of the books (the map on Bilbo\'s table in his house comes to mind, it is exactly as the one in \"The Hobbit\" book that I own), and I also incredibly enjoyed the intro sequence with the re-telling of the battle against Sauron from the Silmarillion, never has an ultimate evil being been so well depicted on the screen. It truly is Sauron.\n\nThose who argue the movie cuts too many parts or that it changes the story too much are totally wrong. This movie could not have shown the whole first time in its entirety - keep in mind that the audiobook version of \'Fellowship of the Ring\' lasts well over ten hours, making a movie this long would, well, make it way too long and besides, how would you financially sustain such a project? I\'ve read a reviewer saying he\'d make all three books with the time allowed for the first movie alone. I think it would be a very fast-forwarding experience of a movie with \'Alvin and the Chimpmunks\' kind of voices, incredibly stupid to say the least.\n\nOk, so there are changes in the movie - well, this is Jackson\'s vision of it. All of us have our own visions of the books, which may or may not be compatible with that of Jackson\'s, but I can safely assume that nobody can say they have a hundred percent the same vision of the story as Tolkien; that\'s the thing with books: each reader has a different vision of it. As for me, I was blown away. Never before have I felt so much at home in a movie, it is as if I had taken a walk in the town where I grew up, the Shire, Rivendell, Moria, Lorien, everything felt so much like home, I was moved. I cannot tell of another movie that had me shed tears just by seeing a landscape on screen.\n\nAs for the changes, well, I found good reasons behind all of them, and let me tell you right away, I was happy that Arwen saved Frodo, yes, maybe coming from a fan it will look like absolute heresy, but I enjoyed the scene a lot. I did not enjoy it because it was supposedly politically-correct to do so, or that I find Liv Tyler to be absolutely attractive; it was just because I felt like even though it was a big change from the book, it was a very good one indeed, it makes you discover the power, determination, and courage of elves and the fact that even elven women, although great in their beauty and seemingly fragile in appearance do not have anything to envy to their male counterparts. And beside, as Arwen is to become a Queen later on, it was pretty good to see her have a great first appearance.\n\nThe actors were great, they were a lot into their characters, and for the first time, I saw elves as they were, quick, agile, terrifyingly effective in battle - just look at how Legolas dealed with the hordes of enemies without a single hint of fear in his eyes - these are elves as they should be. Gimli was great too, I know people seem to think many characters were not developed enough, but by the actions you can learn a lot. With Gimli a lot can be learned about the dwarves, their pride, deep sense of honor and family, their mistrust of elves, their love for strong beer and a good fight against anything bigger, and their sheer hatred for orcs and the likes. Aragorn was totally the ranger character, the ending scene as he walked toward the horde of Uruk-Hai warriors was great, his attitude, his clothes, everything about him just cried \"ranger\". Boromir was very well depicted, desperate to save the people of Gondor, by any mean necessary, robbed of all hope, yet in the end he redeems himself by showing his true valour, deep down, he\'s willing to die to defeat evil, and when he recognizes his king in Aragorn, on his last breath, I felt like watching a hero die, it was moving. The hobbits were all great, Frodo is deeply sad and fatalist, and Sam is just the \'best friend\' everyone would like to have, just as it should be. Finally, we have Gandalf, quite frankly, he looks mighty, Ian IS Gandalf. The faceoff against the Balrog in the Moria is a memorable sequence, and just shows how strong he really is, to be able to vanquish such a foe. I can\'t wait for his return.\n\nQuite frankly, I can\'t wait for the two other movies... In the meantime, I\'ll watch this one over and over again. This movie has everything that a good movie needs to have, and more. Plus, it just might bring more people to actually read books that have more pages than the average little 25¢ novel that has no value in it, which is great. Parents, maybe some scenes will frighten your kids, but this movie has almost NO blood (even though it has a good share of battle) and the foes are undeniably evil, plus it has good values in it - friendship, courage, responsiblity, sacrifice for a good cause, and the belief that anyone can help to change things. This is worthy of Tolkien, this is a movie that will go down in history as being one of the best ever, for sure.'),(600,33,'10/10','An amazing beginning of the trilogy.

Sign in to vote.','It is with no surprise that Peter Jackson\'s The Fellowship of the Ring film has received such mixed critics. Many viewers refer to it as being childish, boring and uninteresting. Seems to me that it is bound to the same fate of Tolkien\'s books, destined to be a target for the same type of misunderstandings that keep attacking this literary masterpiece many decades after it\'s first publication.\n\nHaving read the books several years ago, I went to see this `impossible\' film when it came out with many doubts on my mind. I really liked it, but left the theater with as many doubts as I had before. Was it perfect? Well, maybe not, but what an achievement. After watching it a few times on DVD, and thinking about it for some time now, I find myself loving this film more and more. Let me tell you why...\n\nThe Lord of the Rings is a fairy-tale of myth and fantasy. Peter Jackson directed a film that was considered, for a very long time, impossible to make, and not only for technical reasons. The narrative roots are incredibly long and detailed, and the storyline is deeply connected with the creation of a fantastic continent from a time unknown called `Middle Earth\'. It\'s author, Tolkien, dedicated a considerable part of his life developing this continent\'s background, it\'s mythology and origins, it\'s different kinds of people, cultures and languages, and therefore it\'s geographic references are determinant to the unfolding of the story of the One Ring.\n\nPeter Jackson went out to achieve the impossible and came out with a recreation of the original that is pure and true to the story in every detail. The first time the four hobbits meet a black rider on the road, for example, is absolutely faithful to the feeling of the book. The assault of the riders at Weathertop is another great example, and it captures that feeling of danger, density and atmosphere that are the main characteristics of the tale. Jackson also took some liberties with the story, and made some right choices along the way. If the so called `purists\' may not approve the removal of Tom Bombadil altogether, it should be comprehensible that the travel from Hobbiton to Rivendel is a very long and detailed one and could easily make a movie on it\'s own. I felt more uneasy with how short the Council of Elrond was. In the book, the council is where the whole story of the rings is first explained, and many passages from the past ages of Middle Earth are unveiled. It is a fascinating moment of the story, that had to be shortened for obvious reasons. Still, after some consideration, I now agree with the options made by Peter Jackson, and think that the movie prologue narrated by Galadriel was the wisest choice. The magic is all there when Gandalf shuts his eyes the moment Frodo stands in the council and says `I will take the ring\'. It is there at Moria\'s Gate, and at the fall of Boromir. It is a powerful film that doesn\'t fit the rhythm of the standard Hollywood action movie. It is a film that breeds, that takes time to unfold, it\'s tale branching in every direction.\n\nI could go on and on, talking about all the different elements that bring this film close to perfection, but I\'ll end saying that deep down, this is not about action, beards and big monsters. The greatest thing about this film, to me, is that it brought me back to a time when I was in love with a different world where everything was possible. Reading The Lord of the Rings night after night, I came to understand what this thing of `mankind\' really was all about. The corruption of absolute power, the importance and value of friendship, the inevitability of growing up, the strength of hope... That this film could capture that magic, and be a new bearer to it\'s message of humanism, is a statement to it\'s greatness. Gandalf\'s words, that even the smallest person may change the course of the world, and have a part to play in the destiny of all, are immortal.\n\nIn the end, this is a wonderful film, but that doesn\'t mean you are going to like it. I cannot tell you what it is like to see this film if you don\'t know or love the book. But I hope it may plant a seed on your heart to discover a great world of fantasy, beauty and humanity. I believe Tolkien would have liked that.'),(604,33,'10/10','Unbelievably Good That Stands The Test Of Time','martimusross','5 March 2020','The Lord Of The Rings Trilogy\n\nPerhaps the best adaptation of a gargantuan novel ever made thus far.\n\nWords defy analysis but in short all the forces are martialled by Peter Jackson in service of the story that is enabled with a breadth and scope never before achieved before this.\n15 out of 15 found this helpful.

After repeating that phrase on a number of occasions the question popped into his mind: \"Well, why not the `The Lord of the Rings\' itself?\". In doing this he, of course, set himself an enormous challenge: he had to make a really good `fantasy\' film, one which would stand on its own and be true to what he had originally wanted to do but he would also, and here the task he had set himself was enormous, be true to the original book and to make a film which the legions of people who have loved this book would feel happy with. In the latter task he was certainly not helped by the author or the book: Tolkein, it would seem, hated cinema. The book itself is `HUGE\': this was not going to be the kind of task that the James Ivory team set themselves, or Scorsese nor the kind of task facing Branagh with Hamlet; nor was it going to be like the puny task that faced Columbus with `Harry Potter\' who had the bigger budget ($130 million for one film as compared with Peter Jackson with $300m for three).\n\nI have just seen the first `volume\' and can say without hesitation that he has succeeded in both his goals. It is not the book but a reading of the book which is inventive and fascinating. It is the kind of experience that makes you want to go back and reread the whole thing in the light of the emphases that Jackson has brought to the story. He focuses on the corrupting influence of the ring and, through this focus, the character of the chief protagonists of the story are revealed. Clearly those most tempted by it are mortal men (Boromir and even, in one moment, Aragorn), those who already have power (Elrond - `The ring cannot stay here\'; Galadriel; Gandalf and Saruman), and, of course, those who would not normally desire it but who by accident become ring bearers - Gollum, Bilbo, Frodo. I can see why, in this reading, Jackson decided to leave out the Bombadil episode. Bombadil, like the Balrog, is beyond the ring but the latter is important to the unfolding of the story of the fates of all the characters, Bombadil isn\'t.\n\nIt is a miracle of this reading of the first volume of the book that one can see where Jackson is going and one can get a feel of how the reading is going to unfold. In a sense, Jackson\'s real trial - as far as those who know the books are concerned - will come with the second film in the series. He has lived up to our expectation by creating even bigger ones: how can he handle the story of the chase andrescue of Merry and Pippin, the storming of Isengard etc - stories which don\'t really add much to the core theme that is emerging. Or is he now going to add the theme of the great contest of good versus evil to the unfolding reading?\n\nAll of this points to the fact that the film, even though it is a feast of special effects, focuses on character. And this also explains why Jackson chose the actors he did for their roles: they are not `big\' names - no `Sean Connery\', no `Alan Rickman\', no `Brad Pitt\', no `Sam Neill\'etc. He didn\'t want them getting in the way of the story of character. Ian McKellan\'s talents, in particular, are used to tell a large proportion of the story: an enormous amount is conveyed simply through his facial expressions and even by the language of his body. The other miracle in all of this is Elijah Wood. Like many others, when I first heard of Jackson\'s choice, I groaned: but Wood has been extraordinary. He brings, as one friend said, a strange kind of androgyny to the role and this is just perfect. McKellan has already been knighted: give Wood the Oscar.\n\nAnd then there is Middle Earth: this is, as someone put it, another character in the story and the New Zealand landscape, digitally enhanced on occasion, lives up to its role too.\n\nEnough. See this film! Greatest film ever made? How can one make a claim like that! Silly really; as silly as claiming that `The Lord of the Rings\' is the greatest book ever written. Can\'t one simply love a story, enjoy reading it a number of times amd lose oneself in it. One CAN claim that it is the greatest work in its genre as is the film.\n\n10/10'),(606,33,'10/10','Absolute game changer','griffithxjohnson','13 August 2022','Absolutely epic!

Time, and multiple rewatching as, can cause us to forget how impossible the whole project seemed before the world saw it; we forget how strange and independent spirited parts of it are; we forget the references too and evidence of Jackson\'s roots in horror cinema; we forget the narrative excitement that propels a film adapted from a source that is more discursive, more of a scene-setter.

Although George Lucas\' movies are good in their own right (except for the juvenile elements he puts in to sell toys to finance the franchise), his scripts (which borrow heavily from J.R.R.Tolkien, mythology & religion) can\'t compare with the brilliance of the literary trilogy `The Lord of the Rings\'. Granted, Lucas took on a herculean task in writing & directing his story himself, but Tolkien\'s words, along with Peter Jackson\'s faithful adaptation & inspired vision, have created something no one man could equal.\n\nOf course, it helps that Jackson insisted on at least a 2 picture deal, & New Line Cinema was brave enough to foot the bill up front for 3 movies. They spent $180 million to film all 3 simultaneously. With the New Zealand exchange rate, that equals $360 million ($90 million ea.), but since they used many of the same sets, and FX development costs were spread throughout, we\'re seeing $120-$150 million on the screen. This will ensure consistency in plot, casting, tone, etc.\n\nIn 3 hours, Jackson has crammed everything essential from the first novel & then some into the film, rewriting some scenes & dialogue with lesser characters for the leads, leaving out only what there wasn\'t enough time for. Basically, you have two 90 min. movies running back to back. There are no slow spots, just one climax after another. From the opening 10 min. backstory where the Dark Lord Sauron is shown on the battlefield wiping out men & elves 10 at a time with each swing of his mace, I was blown away. The romance between Aragorn, king in exile, and Arwen, daughter of the elf-lord, is played up for the \"Titanic\" quotient, but it\'s well done.\n\nThe story, sets, costumes & FX are so rich, you\'ll have to see the film several times to absorb everything. The unspoiled New Zealand locales are spectacular, providing a variety of environments to represent the different settings on the characters\' journey. The location sets are imaginative, detailed & weathered, adding to their believability, while the studio sets match them in meticulousness. The costumes are at once familiar & strange, drawing on both the medievil & the fantastic, but more important, they\'re also functional & practical. The music by Howard Shore is appropriately sweeping, Celtic & folky in keeping with the novel, although it lacks the memorable themes of John Williams or Jerry Goldsmith, but neither would commit a year or more to a 3 picture project. The FX are as they should be, unobtrusive & unnoticed most of the time, there only to support the story not draw attention away from it as in most Hollywood movies which try to coverup illogical plots & bad acting.\n\nI\'m particularly gratified by the casting of Viggo Mortenson as Aragorn which was a last minute stroke of luck when the actor first chosen for the part backed out due to differences with the director. I\'ve always thought Mortenson had an intensity & striking but not pretty-boy looks that could portray a flawed, dangerous hero instead of the villains Hollywood always picked him for.\n\nA stellar cast giving some of their best performances, visuals that deliver beyond what I imagined, a perfect mix of humor, passion & tragedy, and a feeling of grandeur, scope & impending doom. Perhaps as an ensemble piece with so many characters & the inability to concentrate on any one, it can\'t be measured against some of the classic character study films, but even the casual moviegoer can grasp the ideas & not get lost As far as I\'m concerned, it\'s one of the greatest films of all time.'),(610,33,'3/10','Dishonest Hollywood fluff','Clavicle13','3 January 2005','Due to popular demand, some of the reasons why Lord of the Rings is a poor film :\n\nThis movie is so stifled by nonsense and Hollywood tricks that it\'s hard to discern, beneath it, the work of a purportedly intelligent, talented, and celebrated author beneath it.\n\nTo begin with: there are way too many closeups in this movie. Why couldn\'t Peter Jackson simply let us stand back and watch the characters behave? Why does the camera have to keep poking into the characters\' faces, looking for subtle clues? Maybe Jackson\'s been spending too much time watching the moronic trash of Spielberg, the most overrated director of all time who still hasn\'t learned how to let go of the audience\'s hand.\n\nThe melodramatic soundtrack, far from sustaining or assisting the story, cheapens it and, as Spielberg is so adept at doing, leads me to believe that the intended audience is probably those people who don\'t like to think too hard. This film would\'ve been far improved if Jackson had simply left out the lousy soundtrack.\n\nThe special effects generally do not add anything to the story.\n\nAnd there is plenty of plain illogical nonsense in here. For one example, i think we can all agree that it\'s physically impossible for a human being to outrun an absolutely normal, healthy horse. If a person is being followed at full gallop by a horse, the horse will always catch up. Also, i always have trouble swallowing scenes wherein one or two people capably defeat an army of assailants counting ten, twenty, or more, unless these one or two heroes or heroines happen to have superhuman traits or at least an extraordinarily exceptional degree of training. I\'m not aware of whether or not this sort of occurrence is consistent with the actual text, but as i watch the film, i can\'t help feeling lost in all of Jackson\'s nonsense.\n\nAnd so much swooping! Why so much swooping? More Spielberg influence. I admit there\'s also swooping in Heavenly Creatures, but by now his swooping has become quite distracting. Why can\'t we just watch the characters? Isn\'t Jackson supposed to be telling us a story?\n\nI like Jackson\'s earlier films, and Heavenly Creatures is a brilliant and compelling one, and clearly his best. But now he\'s off remaking King Kong... maybe he\'s gotten lost in Hollywood. Someone please help him find his way out!\n\nPeter Jackson had the potential of making a great film which could\'ve lasted many decades as a classic, but instead he made a sloppy moneymaker. What a loss.\n\nBut then again, perhaps this movie was made for children.\n\nOn the plus side, the pretty New Zealand landscapes are nice to look at.'),(611,34,'5/10','The charm has slowly diminished','SoumikBanerjee1996','10 April 2024','Gorgeous visuals, fun combats, and lots of variety in characters; I feel children, especially those who belong to the age bracket of 5-10, will have a great time with it.\n\nHowever, teenagers or matured adults may have reservations about the film, particularly those who have grown up with this series and hold the franchise in high regard.

If I had to come up with a word to describe the film, it would merely be, \"passable.\" I chuckled a couple of times and my kids (6 & 7) loved it. At the end of the day, I suppose that\'s money well spent. That being said, I am a huge fan of many DreamWorks franchises, including the first 3 KFP films, with the 3rd installment being the weakest of them, but still a good time. Compared to KP4, which didn\'t really add anything to the franchise, the 3rd film is a masterpiece. I found the pacing and the humor of KP4 all over the map. It felt like the film was rushing the audience along without time to really feel any of the emotions it wanted us to feel. It felt like a Saturday morning cartoon rather than a memorable addition to the KFP film canon.\n\nSo, in the end, I\'m glad my kids loved it because I am promptly going to forget everything about this movie. When I think of KFP, scenes like Po finding inner peace in the ruins of his village in KFP 2 will always readily come to mind.

Firstly they ditched a lot of the voice actors from the original series, and so what they did was they either shoehorned them out of the story with some lame excuse, or just not gave them lines and just had them appear silent. The emotional depth is there, but again, its just a step down from what we\'ve grown to expect from kung fu panda. The movie has a lot of filler and pointless subplots, po is reduced to a whiny baby in the first 10 minutes of the movie, the pacing is off, and the villain, OH MAN the villain was weak. Again, not the worst thing in the world, but her motives were purely contradictory from things that were established in the movies universe, shes never portrayed as a real threat.

Viola Davis was a great addition, but Awkwafina\'s presence felt awkward and annoying. The absence of the Furious Five was noticeable, and the two-father subplot was just okay.

Comedy is getting worse and worse; even if I prefer the humor of the first two movies, the third managed to get some laughs out of me, this one didn\'t. I wish the directors understood that what made the first two films successful was how deep the story was and how well the characters were developed, something that was lost in this one. Yes, it\'s a movie for kids, but the previous ones were also and they still managed to touch on dark themes and be enjoyable for adults; I\'m currently 22 years old and I never got tired of watching Kung Fu Panda 2, laughing, crying and getting emotional like when I was 11.

Awkwafina is the ideal counterpart for this double act and their chemistry almost makes up for the lack of the furious five.\n\nViola Davis brings a commanding presence and some solid humour to the chameleon which is needed more than ever considering how weak the villain\'s motivation is. Bryan Cranston and James Hong remain a wonderful double act and Ian McShane deserved something more substantial for Tai Lung\'s long awaited return.\n\nDirector Mike Mitchell and co-director Stephanie Ma Stine ensure the action has the speed and satisfying choreography whilst taking time for some stylish flourishes. The animation is as vibrant and detailed as usual, keeping the same style as before opposed to a post Spider-verse reinvention.\n\nThe score by Hans Zimmer and Steve Mazzaro disappointingly goes unnoticed for the most part, which kinda felt like a given.

Somehow, he still gives some heart to his performance to bring out the deeper levels of Po\'s character development.\n\n-Awkwafina is a newcomer to the game and brings that sass and attitude to the fox character, Zhen. A great personification of the actress, she\'s a welcome addition to the world, with her humor fitting well into the animal antics.\n\n-And Davis rounds out the acting with a solid performance. The chameleon has a poignant prose, and her status is well-matched to Davis\' strong demeanor, deep, icy voice, and threatening attitude that the actress carries well.\n\nFunny At Many Parts -If you are a fan of Kung Fu Panda humor, chances are you will find enjoyment in the fourth installment.\n\n-Po\'s adventure is loaded with quirky dialog that is innocent and jovial. His naivety is charming to watch, but I like how Po engages with the cavalcade of characters who spice up the antics.\n\n-His dads come along for the ride as well, forming a fun substory that held its charm and cuteness. The little intermissions from the story helped keep the humor fresh and blended nicely to the ending without going too far out of the way to accomplish it.\n\n-Altogether, the movie accomplished much in this department and stuck to its roots for simplistic chuckles and laughs.\n\nDeep Story Components -Despite being a kid\'s film, Kung Fu Panda 4 still manages to give some deeper plot elements that were very relevant to me.\n\n-Po\'s journey keeps evolving with each film, requiring the clumsy oaf to face the changes life throws at him and take the lessons to heart.\n\n-It did not matter with whom he engaged. Po somehow manages to find those vulnerabilities and engage them in a manner that feels legitimate and authentic.\n\n-This helps reign in the movie from becoming too comedic and helps viewers invest a bit more into the film and complete this journey with the panda.\n\nEntertaining End Credits -The first half of the credits gives you more animated goodness with our characters and brings some nostalgia that I quite enjoyed.\n\n-A cover by the lead actor\'s band accompanies the scenes and provides a solid track that matches the theme of the sequence.\n\n-Surprisingly, the song is also quite a good cover with comedy and rock beautifully combining into an engaging and energetic track.\n\nCute And Balanced -The movie accomplishes much in being an entertaining film for all ages to enjoy.\n\n-One level is the heavy emphasis on silly antics, laughable clumsiness, and the censorship that cushions the violet components of the movie.\n\n-Yet, Kung Fu Panda 4 is not pulling punches either. The movie provides plenty of inside jokes and elements for parents and older members to enjoy that helps expand who will enjoy the movie.\n\n-Such a balance is what I loved in nineties movies and this film felt in touch with that balance.\n\nAction That Works Super Well -Surprisingly, I really loved the action of this film and found it to be one of the better sequences I\'ve seen in a while.\n\n-The animation is a solid display of computer-generated imagery, with strong attention to detail to display the martial arts in an accurate manner.\n\n-Dynamic fight sequences unleash the tension of the moment and hold anime level quality of fast punches, wicked reversals, and physics defying finishers. All with that magical twist representative of the lore.\n\nDISLIKES:\n\nMore Of The Same -It\'s a great movie, but the fourth installment still is more of the same design and function as the others.\n\n-While the base is important, I would have enjoyed the movie adding that twist and edge that the first two movies held.\n\n-Or at least reintegrate the other characters a little better to help give a bit more climactic suspense into the movie and elevate the movie\'s inclusion of many new characters.\n\nA Rushed Finale -Another instance of timing issues, this film still struggled to perfect the final battle and finish.\n\n-Po\'s part they knocked out of the park, which was the saving grace of the movie. While the planning, character speeches and last-minute solutions were the weaker elements that needed another ten to fifteen minutes to make it worthwhile.\n\n-Even the touching speech at the end felt a tad drowned out by the quick wrap up, only saved by the transition to the fun credits and the promise something more could still come from this film.\n\nPredictable -No surprises here. King Fu Panda Four doesn\'t add too many twists or surprises that I could not predict early on in the film.\n\n-There isn\'t much more I can say. So don\'t expect any mind-blowing moments, but in a way it doesn\'t matter.\n\nTries A Tad Hard To Be Funny -And like always, Jack Black and the crew sometimes try a bit too hard to get a rise out of you.\n\n-Some lines are a tad over-emphasized, a little too much push to get the line out and get you to laugh.\n\n-Other running jokes become stale or annoying, never knowing when to quit. I suspect such antics will be enjoyed by kids, but viewers like me might just roll their eyes at the constant reiteration.\n\nThe VERIDCT: Kung Fu Panda\'s latest installment may not be the most unique experience I have had, but it certainly is one of the more fun movies I\'ve gotten this year. Sticking to its roots, Po\'s story continues to be a fun adventure filled with family-friendly laughs and balanced storytelling for all ages to enjoy. Beautiful design and animation make the world come to life and strong voice acting helps to further develop the characters we\'ve grown to love. And with action that is very fitting and perhaps some of the better fights I\'ve seen in a long time, the movie accomplishes much in a shorter run time. Sure, a few twists could have broken up the monotony alongside better character usage. A less rushed ending also would have helped this movie end on the strongest foot it could with that wisdom meets humor, but the entertaining credits are a blessing.

But, he just doesn\'t want to be promoted and wants to keep being the Dragon Warrior. Then a bunch of goats just come in and say that Tai is back.

Dead Reckoning: Part One stretches the movie across two films only to seemingly showcase action spectacle after action spectacle while sacrificing character development. Characters I have grown to love over a decade of films felt sidelined, ignored, or wasted. Hayley Atwell\'s new character chewed up most of the screen time, and while she was fantastic, I wanted to see more of the original team.

A 2 hour 43 minute adrenaline rush that contains some of the best action sequences put to film, embarrasses the majority of the competition out there and sets the stage for a magnificent part 2 whilst still being a satisfying adventure in its own right.\n\nThis is possibly the most open and obvious a Mission film has been with its deeper meaning for cinema and what aspect of Cruise\'s career is being dissected this time with a film that focuses on Ethan\'s relationship with women and basically outright declares AI to be a soulless monster and how the human element is always needed (perfect film to release during a writer\'s strike).\n\nTom Cruise is perfect as Ethan Hunt and the strongest aspect this time round is when the film explores what made Ethan who he is and reminds you he genuinely cares about his team but that comes at a cost. Physically, the madman is still going strong with his stunts, driving a bike off a cliff in truly breathtaking fashion.\n\nVing Rhames, Simon Pegg and Rebecca Ferguson remain the best IMF team and all play to their strengths here. The longer this series goes on the more authentic their growing friendship feels. Shea Whigham and Greg Tarzan Davis get more than expected and their buddy cop antics are a lot of fun.\n\nWith Esai Morales\' charismatic yet terrifying Gabriel and Pom Klementieff\'s terrific henchman of few words, this franchise finally has more good villains than bad. The return of Henry Czerny as Kittridge is glorious and he remains as gleefully despicable as his first appearance.\n\nThe best new addition is easily Hayley Atwell. She plays a type of character never seen before in these films which makes her character and dynamic with Cruise fresh in comparison to everyone who\'s come before and their chemistry is magnetic. Instantaneous from the second they interact.\n\nChristopher McQuarrie\'s direction is phenomenal. The action sequences are suitably practical (this is how you spend $290 million), and the camera gets as close to the action as humanly possible, he remains one of the best in the business working at this scale. There\'s plenty of canted angles as a nice homage to De Palma\'s original and it helps give this one its own style in comparison to McQuarrie\'s previous entries.\n\nThe pacing is really impressive with the film feeling like it\'s in a perpetual third act from its first airport heist (which is so much fun).

In another universe Cruse could have been Iron Man and I always felt that his aggression with the Mission: Impossible franchise was his way of making up for that.

The challenge in continuing the \"Mission: Impossible\" franchise is that fans expect each entry to be \"bigger\" and more awe-inspiring than the last. With the seventh film in the series, and the third straight he has directed, writer-director Christopher McQuarrie and superstar actor and daredevil Tom Cruise have managed to accomplish what seemed unlikely ... they have delivered Ethan Hunt\'s biggest and grandest mission yet. Prepare to be awed by the action.\n\nYou should know that this is \"Part One\" and it runs 163 minutes, a full hour longer than most movies, and exponentially more expensive to produce. All this during an age when ultra-high-budget blockbusters are being rumored to be fading from public interest. Of course, we are only one year removed from Tom Cruise\'s TOP GUN: MAVERICK being credited with \'saving cinema\', so stay on alert for a \'sky is falling\' panic. McQuarrie co-wrote the script with Erik Jendresen (\"Band of Brothers\"), and they remain faithful to the characters and storylines established by the TV series creator, Bruce Geller.\n\nThere may never have been an actor more suited to a recurring role than Tom Cruise as Ethan Hunt (Harrison Ford as Indiana Jones might be the closest). The story itself is fairly straightforward, even if the item being chased often feels like a MacGuffin. Your questioning of how a \'simple\' spy-thriller can be effective is understandable, yet it\'s fascinating to watch as Ethan Hunt\'s mission in life as an agent is evaluated, as is the cost he\'s paid as a man. Providing a contemporary theme, the obscure object of desire is an all-powerful key (actually two parts of a key) based on controlling an all-encompassing Artificial Intelligence (AI).\n\nIn a twist on a familiar theme (and a classic comedy film), we have Airports, Trains, and EVs, the latter being a tiny Fiat with handcuffs. Still, the car chase is everything we might hope, while the high-tech facial search in the airport sequence delivers the thrills for techie viewers, and the train sparring occurs inside as well as on top. And lest you be worried, there are enough Cruise sprint scenes here to put CHARIOTS OF FIRE to shame.\n\nFamiliar faces include Ethan Hunt\'s team of Luther (Ving Rhames, who along with Cruise, has appeared in all 7 MI films), Benji (Simon Pegg), and Ilsa Faust (Rebecca Ferguson). It\'s nice to again see (and hear) Henry Czerny as Kittridge, Vanessa Kirby as arms dealer The White Widow, and Esai Morales - as Gabriel, the required villain in search of the same key as our good guys. New faces include Haylee Atwell as master pickpocket Grace, whose soul may or may not be beyond salvation; Cary Elwes as agency director Denlinger; Shea Whigham and Greg Tarzan Davis as officers after rogue Hunt; and Pom Klementieff as a hired assassin.\n\nThe stunt work here is outstanding, and of course, Tom Cruise is renowned for personally handling many of the most breathtaking acts - the most memorable one here being his riding of a motorcycle off a cliff. This stunt has a \'making of\' video that\'s been available for a while. As movie goers, we\'ve never seen anything like it. This part one was originally scheduled for release in 2021 (thanks a lot, COVID), and now Part Two is set for 2024. It\'s been 27 years since the MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE (1996) with Jon Voight ... Cruise was 34 in that one. This particular mission is the biggest yet, and it would certainly be impossible for the rest of us. It\'s a mission that will be closed out in Part Two, and simultaneously bring an end to Cruise\'s remarkable run as Ethan Hunt.\n\nOpening July 12, 2023.'),(646,38,'9/10','I don\'t understand the critics, this is brilliant.','watch_umean','3 January 2020','The writing, directing, acting and the general production are all top notch.

If there has I haven\'t noticed it. He has an ornate ability to take average actors and make them great, and to take already great actors and get even more out of them. There are a few directors around who specialise in this but Ritchie is right near the top. The cast in \'The Gentlemen\' is admittedly fantastic, but it doesn\'t change the fact that they are an absolute treat to watch. Matthew McConaughey is in his element in a role that he was born to play, Charlie Hunnam plays one of the coolest characters I\'ve seen perfectly, Colin Farrell is hilarious and ridiculously cool as well and then Hugh Grant gives one of the best performances I\'ve ever seen from him. In fact Grant was so good I didn\'t even recognise his voice and had to wonder if they\'d dubbed it. They hadn\'t, he\'d just nailed it.\n\nThe style this movie possesses is just so much fun to watch. If you\'ve seen any of Ritchie\'s previous similar films (\'Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels\', \'Snatch\', \'RocknRolla\') then you know what I\'m talking about. The pacing moves at lightning speed, the dialogue is quick, clever and deeper than you first realise and the conflict is always multi-layered. This one is actually told in quite a unique way with a couple of characters going over events that have already happened and it works masterfully. It breaks the story up and gives room for creativity in the story-telling process and also humour.\n\nEvery time I see that Ritchie has made a movie that isn\'t a crime-thriller I get a little disappointed. It\'s not that the other stuff he\'s doing is bad (\'Swept Away\' being an obvious exception), it\'s just that he is so damn good as this style of movie. He\'s the best in the business and if he only did these for the rest of his career I\'d be a very happy man. This is an excellent movie well worth your time and money.'),(648,38,'9/10','That\'s Hugh Grant?! It seems so unlike him in his other films!','planktonrules','13 September 2020','Aside from a few very marketable films like \"Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows\" and \"Aladdin\", Guy Ritchie is a writer/director who makes incredibly violent films. That is, incredibly violent films which are also brilliantly constructed and near perfect. While I rarely ever watch violent films, I eagerly look for his next dark British crime film, after seeing his \"Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels\" and \"Snatch\"....and so it\'s not surprising I\'d see \"The Gentlemen\". And, like these other films, it\'s near perfect...and a film you ought to see if you have the stomach for this sort of story.\n\nSo this leads me to a huge warning. This is NOT a family-friendly film nor one you want to show your mother or Father Jenkins if he stops by for a visit. There\'s ample cursing, loads of violence, vomit galore, and the story is about bad people...very bad people.\n\nThe story is complicated...and goes together like a finely crafted puzzle. It concerns a marijuana czar in Britain, Michael Pearson (Matthew McConaughey) and his desire to sell out and retire to a life of ease and sophistication. However, after making an offer to a rival drug kingpin, suddenly everything goes haywire....folks start dying, farms growing the stuff are hit and an all-out war seems inevitable. There\'s WAY more to the story than this...but since it\'s so complex, it\'s best you just see it to appreciate it.\n\nThe bottom line is that Guy Ritchie can write and direct amazing films...and this one is truly amazing and entertaining. Apart from his misguided vanity project, \"Swept Away\", his output has been impressive and I cannot stress enough what a quality product this film is. My only MINOR quibble is what about the Russian mobster.....what happens with him?

The narrator is a conniving private detective named Fletcher (Hugh Grant), who sets out to blackmail everyone with a screenplay he\'s written. The screenplay is called \"BUSH,\" bush being a euphemism for \"marijuana\" and is a complicated tale about the \"turf war\" in the marijuana business. The \"bush\" double entendre is also present, just for the chuckles factor. Mickey Pearson (Matthew McConaughey) is an American who sees an opportunity in the languishing English aristocracy. He is married to Roz (Michelle Dockery), a \"Cockney cleopatra\" who runs an auto body shop with only women mechanics. Mickey loves his wife and is ready to retire from the weed business. Two rivals emerge as potential buyers: an American Jewish billionaire and a Chinese-Cockney gangster named Dry Eye. Colin Farrell\'s \"Coach\" is an Irish guy who runs a boxing club. Mickey\'s right-hand man is Ray (Charlie Hunnan), a mild-mannered man who looks like a desk clerk until you see him in action. The \"gentlemen\" of the title is clearly meant sarcastically. Hugh Grant gives an extraordinary performance in \"The Gentlemen\". The script, which Ritchie co-wrote with Ivan Atkinson and Marn Davies, plays around with genre tropes, but the overriding structure is Fletcher \"pitching\" his script to an increasingly horrified Ray. This \"pitch\" goes on for the entirety of the film, and so as scenes unfold, it is as though the scenes emanate from Fletcher\'s imagination, when in reality we are seeing what really happened. Guy Ritchie\'s latest gangster comedy presents itself as a harmless romp, but behind its wink-wink-nudge-nudge humour is a bitter and dated worldview. Mickey Pearson (Matthew McConaughey) is an American interloper and marijuana dealer who wants out of the game. He hopes to liquidate his weed-farm empire, and interested buyers include Jewish-American billionaire Matthew Berger (Jeremy Strong) and Chinese mobster \"Dry Eye\" (Crazy Rich Asians\' Henry Golding). We learn of Mickey\'s plans and their inevitable unravelling through a screenplay written by sleazy private investigator and aspiring screenwriter Fletcher (Hugh Grant). The screenplay is, of course, blackmail, with which Fletcher hopes to exploit Mickey. Ritchie\'s signature sweary patter is enjoyable, except for the racism, which is especially pointed given the racial delineation of the film\'s heroes and villains. Fletcher is a parasite, one of those tabloid \"writers\" who loves to be \"in\" on things, and sees people and their reputations as disposable. The entire script is a script within a script, and this is its ace in the hole: there is always one layer between us and the characters. Hugh Grant has become a formidable character actor in the last couple of years, taking full advantage of his options. The one-two punch of \"Paddington 2\" and \"A Very English Scandal\" is a perfect example of this, as Grant is using all of these other acting muscles he normally hadn\'t been asked to use, and he\'s thrilling in a role which is mostly exposition. There\'s one moment where he puts his hand on Hunnam\'s knee, realizes it\'s an unwelcome touch, and goes into this wild pop-eyed, \"Oopsie #sorrynotsorry\" facial expression. It\'s his favorite kind of humor, character-based, behavior-based, and he acts as his own gravitational force.

And it didn\'t strike a cord of being a real-life engaging thriller to me either. It\'s very stylized. And although style can work in certain circumstances when the viewer is appropriately brought on-board. I felt like the plane left without me. A style really doesn\'t work if the characters become too artificial while trying to play-off an essence of reality at the same time.\n\nMuch of the story about the main character (McConaughey\'s) is delivered as investigative conjecture from another character(Grant\'s). So as the narrator character reveals the main character\'s story, the narrator can later change the result of events we perceive by just revealing that the conjecture he presented before was inaccurate. This gets old really fast.\n\nMaybe this can work if the conjecture is absurd and funny or if the conjecture rings very true most of the time. That way it surprises the viewer when it\'s revealed to be wrong. But as I explained before, I didn\'t overall get a sense of either quality within the story-telling.\n\nOverall the film seemed very ambitious. But all of the pieces didn\'t seem to quite make sense to me together. And they might have been better off removing a few elements for this particular script.\n\nI wasn\'t too sympathetic for the characters I was supposed to be sympathetic for. I didn\'t understand the logic to some of the character decisions. Some of the moments of \"big reveals\" didn\'t seem too surprising to me. And a lot of the narration got annoying to me. More often than not it\'s better to show than tell the viewer what they need to know. I didn\'t think the voiceover was helpful in showing but telling. To put it simply, I felt it was more style than more substance. And the music didn\'t seem to help the storytelling to me either.\n\nI hope you like it if you see. But I also hope that if you have similar concerns and inclinations as me, that my review might spare you some time and/or money.

We\'ve seen Joker scavenger hunts and one of the largest viral campaigns in advertising history and it culminates with the actual release of the movie.\n\nEverything that\'s been said is pretty much spot on. This is the first time I can remember where a summer blockbuster film far surpasses the hype.\n\nFor as much action as there is in this movie, it\'s the acting that makes it a great piece of work. Between all the punches, explosions and stunt-work is some great dialog work. All the actors have their moments.\n\nBale\'s Batman is the definitive Batman because we see everything in this character finally on film. Martial arts skills, cunning, great tactical thinking, forensic application, technological genius to advance or improve Luscious Fox\'s inventions/technological breakthroughs, intimidating personality, and even a little swashbuckling.\n\nAs for Heath, yes he gets credit for his performance as the Joker. But you have to also recognize Jonathan and Chris Nolan for the writing and treatment of the character. It\'s not just the fact that Ledger makes the Joker so menacing, but the Nolans have given the character this great manifesto that drives its actions. The Joker\'s stance on chaos, order, anarchy, the morality of the average modern human being make the character so interesting psychologically. The Nolans drafted a complex character and only a perfect performance could\'ve pulled something like this off. That\'s how difficult of a role this was, and that\'s why Ledger\'s performance is so great.\n\nThis isn\'t an action movie. It\'s a film that explores literary themes of the hero and villain, as well as order and anarchy. Yes, listen to the dialog because it\'s all in there.'),(672,39,'10/10','Heath Ledger\'s Dark and Brilliant Swan Song','filmquestint','20 July 2008','I couldn\'t believe \"The Dark knight\" could live up to the hype.

A fearless, extraordinary actor capable to fill up with humanity even the most grotesque of villains. His performance is a master class.

Christopher Nolan and his co-writer Jonathan Nolan deserve a standing ovation. I don\'t usually go for loud movies filled with mindless gore and violence. \"The Dark Knight\" is certainly loud and violent but it\'s not mindless. It has depth and soul. Even the Joker, in an extraordinary creation by Heath Ledger, is deeply human. The natural petulance of Christian Bale makes his ego and alter ego the most fascinating and complex of all film superheroes. Part of the genius of this movie is that Batman himself, in screen time, is not really the lead. My attention was captivated by Heath Ledger and he determines and inspires the breathtaking atmosphere that envelopes Gotham as well as us. The aplomb of Christopher Nolan as a director is mind blowing and his secret, I believe, is his obvious respect for his audience. What he\'s done is to elevate a popular genre into Shakesperean proportions. Bravo!\n514 out of 663 found this helpful. Was this review helpful?

And it was my first movie in an IMAX theatre. I can only recommend it for anyone who has the chance to watch it, even if not the entire movie is shot for an IMAX theatre, this still is able to blow someone away! Great visuals combined with a great story and superb acting.\n\nThe movie could also have been called \"The Joker\", but even with Heath Ledgers great performance, this still is a Batman movie. And \"The Dark Knight\" is clear enough, even without the Batman in the title. I simply loved the movie, but I heard some complaints from some friends. It seems that some might have a problem with the depiction of the characters (I loved Heath Ledger, but there are a few out there who would have wanted to see him even crazier) or the plot threads (especially what is done with the character of Aaron Eckhart).

With the success of 2005\'s reboot of the Batman franchise, they took what was already established and expanded it, amped it up, and gave a deeper, darker and brooding story that is more gripping and the suspense is likely to catch you of guard several times throughout. Christian Bale delves more deeper into Batman, sworn to fight evil and injustice, though also quite reluctant and uncertain if his crusade can ever end and cleanse his inner turmoil from his fractured soul due to the murder of his beloved parents. But with the help of his trusted butler/ally Alfred (played superbly by Michael Cane) grounds him, gives him moral support, and keeps him in check. But the real star of the show is Heath Ledger as Batman\'s most deadly enemy, The Joker. I can HONESTLY tell you that: as good as Jack Nicholson was in Batman\'89 he is CHILD\'S PLAY compared to this Joker. He is sadistic, psychotic, and downright SCARIER and PSYCHOLOGICALLY disturbing than the previous incarnation of The Clown Prince of Crime and Ledger gives it his all to do him justice. Along with the original cast comes some fresh faces such as Aaron Eckhart, Maggie Gyllenhaal and more. I must say though I liked Katie Holmes, Gyllenhaal gives a much better performance and is a far cry from the \"damsel-in-distress\" stereotype (though there\'s a little of it, THANKFULLY) that\'s common in films. Bale and Gyllenhall have MUCH better chemistry this time around more so than Holmes. Even better, the fight sequences are vastly improved and feature more brutal and bone crushing combat than \"Begins\" in addition to new technology at Batman\'s disposal. Also worth mentioning is screenwriter Jonathan Nolan, who gives the film an added frosting to an already delicious cake. Simply put, The Dark Knight is totally more bad ass than \"Begins.\" The action is great, and the plot is more deeper and engrossing. I applaud Christopher Nolan, Christian Bale, and especially Heath Ledger (who sadly passed away earlier this year) and all those aboard for believing in Mr. Nolan\'s talents for this second installment. Although some may feel a bit of melancholy over Ledger\'s death, but as a final note I will say this sincerely from my heart: Remember Heath Ledger and honor him in your minds and hearts not only for his performances, but as a human being and father to his daughter Matilda Ledger. May we issue him best wishes for his family and friends and his daughter for years to come. Remember . . . Honor him not only for this role and past roles, but as an incredible individual and talented actor. Rest in peace.

After each of the prequel \"Star Wars\" films, I rated that one the best, as good as any of the originals...for a time, until my opinion balanced out and I had a more well-rounded take. For that reason, I steer away from that mindset, and did for \"Dark Knight\".\n\nThough my opinion is solidifying already after having seen a Warner Bros. screening last night, \"Dark Knight\" ably stands on its own with or without \"Batman Begins\". At a two and a half hour runtime, it\'s definitely an epic of a movie, but one that never runs out of gas. A delightful addition to this experience was a healthy amount of IMAX footage, which significantly adds to the feel of being on a personal, and gruesome, tour of Gotham City.\n\nChristian Bale plays such a well rounded Batman and Bruce Wayne, qualities that none of those who have donned the cowl before him have pulled off. I still have to remember that Bale is British since he speaks with such a spot on American accent. Bale has a particular slurring lisp that serves him quite well, charmingly for Bruce Wayne and threateningly for Batman.\n\nCountering him is the late Heath Ledger, who plays such a scary and creepy Joker that I found it impossible to NOT have chills half the time I saw him on screen. What really separates this brand of Joker from Jack Nicholson\'s portrayal is true unpredictability. It\'s obvious that, to be a good guy and think like the Joker, it really takes a toll, and it sure isn\'t easy. How exactly does one take him down when he\'s woven his harebrained plot around multiple hostages, explosives, or disappearing parlor tricks?\n\nInitially, I was uneasy about how the character of Harvey Dent would be handled. In my mind, there was really only one faithful portrayal of him, and that could be found in the \"Batman\" animated series of the early 90s. As well as Tommy Lee Jones COULD have handled him in \"Batman Forever\", he certainly did not, though it still was a highlight of that movie. Aaron Eckhart ably assumes the mantle here, delivering a performance out of this world, easily on par with the Batman animated series.\n\nBe it known, this caped avenger stands for the good of Gotham City that the police force and its counterparts can\'t represent, the good that has no jurisdiction, no procedures...and no rules, save for one. I can only hope that we\'ve seen just the prelude to the Dark Knight\'s upcoming legendary battles with the worst of Gotham City\'s dark underside.\n\n\"The Dark Knight\" gets a solid 10 of 10 stars.'),(683,39,'10/10','Best in it\'s class and much more','sjvkarki','16 January 2021','This is the best superhero movie ever made!!!!

It was dark, full of explosions and looked really cool. Being a huge fan of Batman and the two Burton films I couldn\'t wait to see it. While I never saw it in cinemas, I remember my friends telling me it was amazing and one of the best films ever. Fast forward to when I finally got to see the film and it was a different story.\n\nTwo and a half hours of the most pretentious, boring and disappointing film I had ever seen. Lets start with the plot(s). Basically, the Joker (atleast that\'s what they call him) starts killing people and causing mayhem, meaning Batman has to stop him. Sounds simple but the film spoils this by having too many plot lines, most of which have nothing to do with the actual plot, don\'t last long enough to be interesting and could have been easily cut out to make a shorter and easier to follow plot.\n\nNow for the hero and villain. Batman is played by Christian Bale and comes complete with an over the top gruff voice, which sounds like he smoked a entire packet of cigarettes while doing a cross country marathon. He\'s nowhere near as dark or as intimidating as Keaton\'s Batman and isn\'t very engaging as Bruce either. Now for the reason the film is considered to be so great, Heath Ledger as the Joker. Ledger is the main driving point of the film and the most interesting character. He plays the role very convincingly and I\'ll admit is the best part of the film, even though they could have called him anything else instead of \'the Joker\' and it would have been the same.\n\nAnd that\'s my biggest problem with this film, it doesn\'t feel like a Batman film. Batman has always been a surreal franchise, meaning it walks on a line between the real world and a fantasy world. Why does Gotham City just look like and regular city? Why does the Joker not have any comical death contraptions? Why does the Batmobile look like a tank? Where are all Batman\'s unique gadgets? The problem is Nolan doesn\'t understand that a man who dresses up as a Bat and fight crime can\'t be taken completely seriously. Burton made a surreal world for Batman and Batman Returns, creating a perfect environment for his films. But with Nolan, all I think of is just a crime drama with Batman in it. The Joker could have been just a psycho with makeup.\n\nThe pacing is also a flaw. Sometimes the film moves too quickly for us to digest what\'s going on and other time it goes to slow that we lose interest. Only reason people loved it was for Heath Ledger\'s amazing performance and his unfortunate passing away before the film\'s release, and even that doesn\'t fit the bill for a \'Batman\' movie. To sum up, \'The Dark Knight\' will go down in history as the most overrated film ever made.'),(685,40,'8/10','Fun, funny and wild','FeastMode','3 August 2022','This is a highly entertaining action-comedy that oozes style. It\'s extremely fun and a bit on the outrageous side, not meant to be taken too seriously. It\'s filled with funny and memorable moments. The action is awesome, well-shot and clear, which is no surprise coming from the guy who directed John Wick, Atomic Blonde and Deadpool 2.\n\nThere are a ton of characters and I like them all. The cast does such a great job, especially Brian Tyree Henry and Aaron Taylor-Johnson. I remember first seeing Brian Tyree Henry in Atlanta and really enjoying that role. Since then, he has taken on vastly different roles and killed all of them. And I already thought Aaron Taylor-Johnson is a great actor, but the way he completely transforms into his character is remarkable. To the point where you don\'t see Aaron Taylor-Johnson. Literally. I didn\'t realize it was him until the credits rolled.\n\nIf I had to come up with negatives, I would say it\'s a bit hectic at times, but not enough to take me out of it. And the story borders on being convoluted, but I was able to follow it all so I\'ll call it intricate instead.\n\nIn the end I had a great time with this movie and would definitely watch it again, although I\'ll be turning on subtitles since some dialogue was hard to understand in a Snatch kind of way.\n\nEDIT: On second viewing, my negatives disappeared.

With this in mind, it was almost impossible to not see parts of trailers for Bullet Train, whether that was on TV or YouTube advertising etc. The marketing campaign for this film is mental, I have seen it everywhere.\n\nThe trailer makes the movie look like a massive bloated action piece - Think Nonstop meets Train to Busan. However, having watched a couple of YouTube film reviews, I was pleasantly surprised to see it described as not just a brainless action movie, but more of a dialogue-based film with clever writing and fast paced back and forth. One reviewer compared it to Guy Ritchie\'s Snatch and the classic Pulp Fiction - Two of my favourite and most watched movies. That was enough for me, I was going to give it a try and I booked a couple of tickets for opening day, something that I don\'t do very often.\n\nLet\'s start with the Dialogue. If anything, it just tries too hard, far too hard. Most of the jokes didn\'t land for me and the delivery of the fast-paced dialogue quite often would not hit the mark. I can\'t quite but my finger on why that is. Is it simply poor writing? Or is it down to the delivery? Or is it simply that a number of my favourite movies are heavy, witty dialogue-based movies and my expectations were so high based on several reviews, that I just felt disappointed by this? Either way, it didn\'t really work for me.\n\nAs you can imagine, almost all the action scenes involved in this movie were delivered on a train, meaning that the fight scenes needed to be compact and tight. This was delivered better than I expected to be fair and plenty of the action scenes were enjoyable, if not incredibly farfetched.\n\nThe characters were relatively varied but were quite generic and cliché. Brad Pitt is essentially the lead actor and probably the best on show. Aaron Taylor-Johnson and Brian Tyree Henry (Tangerine and Lemon) were the characters which I was most excited to see, they played the east end cockney gangster/hitmen type characters. Unfortunately, they came across as just trying far too hard and the chemistry between them just wasn\'t as good as I imagine the director and producers thought it would be. The Thomas the Tank Engine metaphor also got repetitive after the 25th time it was mentioned. The rest of the cast are hit and miss, nothing majorly impressive and nothing majorly terrible. There are some strange cameos, and when I say cameos, I mean cameos. They literally get seconds of screen time.\n\nOverall, Bullet Train was entertaining enough as a popcorn flick and was an inoffensive way of turning my brain off for two hours and relaxing. I do feel that it\'s a slightly wasted opportunity though as I can see what the director was trying to do, but it just felt flat and missed the mark on quite a few occasions.

An ensemble cast with a few different stories in it, of which, interestingly enough Brad Pitt\'s story as a man named Ladybug could be considered just as important as the others despite being the star.\n\nUnlike Smoking Aces, the Bullet Train in itself is a character and a very expensive one that makes it a blockbuster. On top of that the very cool Celebrity Cameos that prove this director makes friends with everyone he works with in Hollywood.\n\nThe Japanese back drop was cool not just because I\'m an anime fan but because it made the film and the bullet train visual amazing to look at, but Hollywood needs more Japanese actors who can speak English.

It is two hours of relentless action. It\'s actually a little exhausting to watch (it didn\'t help that the theatre I saw it in was set to about 30 degrees Celsius - but that\'s a different matter) - in a good way though.\n\nThis is a very stylishly made film. It looks terrific. The acting is great and all the characters are very polished and cool as you would expect in a film about assassins. The train itself is an interesting setting too. It\'s technically a single-setting film but it never feels like it. The film moves so fast you feel like you are darting from country to country.\n\nI would say the one let down of the film was how little of the humour landed. Time and again there was an obvious attempt at a joke and I just didn\'t find even a smile coming to my face. There are some laughs along the way, but the hit to miss ratio is way off.\n\nIt\'s a lot of fun this movie though regardless. There are endless cameos and twists and unexpected moments.

But the Tarantino and Ritchie films had novelty on their side. And at least with Tarantino, a sense of something richer, deeper beneath the surface. Bullet Train almost pathologically can\'t ever take it self seriously. Some films suffer by taking themselves too seriously; BT has the opposite problem.\n\nPitt is fine as ladybug, he\'s genuinely pretty funny at times, but his hapless character is the heart of the movie, and he\'s a bit of a dope, a therapy neophyte trying to see the deeper meaning of things, to be a better man, but only ever in an unserious way. Nothing really matters about him.

I\'m not rating it highly because it\'s a modern classic, i\'m doing it based on wanting to see a funny and entertaining action movie and in that respect it delivers pretty much everything I went to the cinema for.\n\nThe premise of the film is basic, the cast is solid, the characters are excellent including mini side characters. The humour has a few misses but generally it is a pretty funny movie throughout, they also pay off everything that is set up along the way which makes it a satisfying watch. Also if you are yet to see it, stay through the credits as it does tie up one or two of those loose ends.\n\nThe slight downside for me, were that the run time does sag a little toward the end but it is over 2 hours long and otherwise moved along at a steady rate.\n245 out of 385 found this helpful.

It\'s like a sloppy Tarantino knockoff, and it was hard to follow the overly complicated subplots at times. There were definitely holes, e.g. Why doesn\'t the White Death seek revenge on those who hired people like The Hornet or Tangerine and Lemon, instead of those characters directly? But this is less about a buttoned-up action film and more about comedy I think, and it made me laugh. It tried to have it both ways though, and themes like fate and luck were weakly developed.

Pitt and Leitch worked together on numerous films, starting their work relationship with Fincher\'s Fight Club. Over the past decade, Leitch has become a promising director in the action genre, starting as co-director (he was uncredited) of the first John Wick film, which has since become The Action Movie Franchise of the Decade. Leitch then went solo to helm Atomic Blonde, 2, and Fast and Furious presents: Hobbs and Shaw. Now, Leitch and Pitt reunite for the film Bullet Train, an adaptation of the book of the same name by Kotaro Isaka.\n\nPitt shows off his leading man personality once again as the character Ladybug. A hitman for hire who has found a new belief in pacifism and whose self-confidence has gone way down over the years from jobs going off the rails, making himself believe that he has bad luck. His boss (Sandra Bullock) gives him a simple mission as his first job back. His job is to board a Bullet Train traveling from Tokyo to Kyoto, snatch a briefcase that contains millions of dollars, and get off at the first stop. Simple, right? Well, it turns out to be not that simple, as Ladybug realizes that he is not the only assassin on this train, and they are all connected to a ruthless Russian mobster known to them as The White Death (Michael Shannon).\n\nThe assassin\'s on this train include Lemon and Tangerine (Brian Tyree Henry and Aaron Taylor Johnson), twin brothers hired to bring the White Death\'s son (Logan Lerman) back to him, along with the briefcase. The Prince (Joey King) is a young girl on a mission to kill The White Death. Kimura (Andrew Koji) is a father trying to find the person responsible for the attempted murder of his son, along with his father The Elder (Hiroyuki Sanada), an aging samurai who suffered at the hands of The White Death. The Wolf (Bad Bunny), a member of the Mexican Cartel who seeks vengeance for the murder of his wife, and The Hornet (Zazie Beetz), an assassin who uses the venom from a rare snake on her targets.\n\nBullet Train excellences with the visual presentation, unlike the fair share of modern-day action films. The cinematography is very colorful and vibrant. Lots of care into the framing of each shot. One scene, in particular, is shot through the POV of an object, and it\'s beautifully executed. Leitch brings his history of stunt work into the film by providing entertaining action scenes that never feel cheap or manipulated. Every punch and kick feels real. The camera work also helps with the action, making it feel electric. Action films of modern times don\'t have anymore. They rely on the workings of shaky cam and editing tricks to hide the imperfections with the action but hiding this only makes the film worse because this mashup makes the film look messy and unprofessional. The action makes each scene feel fun and keeps the audience. The production design is creative as well. Most films that take place in one setting suffer from having the locations feel dull, but Bullet Train keeps it exciting by having several different locations all packed into one, and each one feels unique with its lighting\n\nThe performances are superb compared to most in the action genre. Brad Pitt isn\'t doing much that he hasn\'t already done in the last two decades, but his leading man charisma still leaves the audience loving him. Aaron Taylor Johnson and Brian Tyree Henry\'s chemistry is so strong that it\'s one of the most entertaining dynamic duos in recent memory.\n\nThe film fails with its messy screenplay. The film resembles a hodgepodge of every Guy Ritchie and Quentin Tarantino film, to the point that it feels like a ripoff. The problem doesn\'t come from the notion that a screenwriter would want to make a film that pays homage to his favorite writers/directors. Tarantino built his entire career by copying the style of other filmmakers and writers. The problem with this is that it lacks the originality of those films and feels like it\'s giving us the best moments of those movies without offering anything new and this style done wrong causes major pacing problems, making a two-hour film feel way longer than it should. The editing feels jumbled, committing the ultimate sin of modern movies: spelling everything out for the audience. It\'s like the director thinks the audience is too dumb to remember something that happened earlier, so his way of working around it is to keep showing us those same moments until it becomes repetitive. The characters aren\'t developed properly, so at the end of the day, nothing feels earned. While the characters are fun to watch and keep your interest throughout the runtime, the emotions aren\'t there for them to hit. When bad things happen to them, it never fully gives brings out the intended emotions that the audience is supposed to feel.\n\nBullet Train is a technical achievement spoiled by its messy storytelling. A fun movie to see in theaters but one that isn\'t worth a revisit at home.\n\n6/10.'),(701,40,'9/10','Most fun I\'ve had in a theater all year','cardsrock','4 September 2022','Bullet Train is a nonstop thrill ride that delivers some of the most fun I\'ve had watching a film in ages.

Yet non of them ever are shown to exit.\n\nThey couldn\'t even get one of the most obvious facts right about the snake venom, \"The venom of the boomslang snake was analyzed and it was revealed that boomslang venom is highly potent and primarily is a hemotoxin.\n\nHemotoxins are toxins that destroy red blood cells, disrupt blood clotting and can also cause organ and tissue damage. Because boomslang venom is a hemotoxin it\'s not surprising that it can lead to major brain and muscle hemorrhage. But the venom also causes other symptoms like nausea, headaches and sleepiness. Perhaps what is most surprising is that this venom has the ability to make the victim bleed from every possible orifice. It is not uncommon for blood to seep out of the victim from the gums, nostrils, urine, saliva, stools, vomit and even through the tiniest of cuts. This is extremely unfortunate because the victim will continue to bleed until death and death from internal bleeding is a slow and lingering process that can take anywhere from three to five days.\n\nOne of the issues with boomslang venom is that symptoms emerge only several hours after being bitten. Because the venom is not fast acting, victims may not realize that they are at serious risk and require immediate medical assistance. Although records show that less than ten people have died from boomslang bites worldwide, this ought to not be taken lightly. Death came swiftly for Karl Schmidt, as he was found dead 24 hours later in his home from respiratory arrest and severe brain hemorrhaging. If Schmidt had known about the anti-venom his life might have been spared.

Acting wise Mr Pattinson is impressive (but my favorite roles of his are as Neil, Cedric Diggory and Rev. Teagardin) - as Batman, remember this is Bats in year 2 and Mr Pattinson nails it as well. A fine actor (not better than Mr Keaton but that is childhood nostalgia maybe however just as batty as Mr Bale..Mr Affleck was awesome as well but scripting for him was below par).\n\nMs Kravitz was maybe born to play Selina (at least this gritty version). I honestly disliked Ms Kravitz in X-Men and Grindlewald but liked her in Big Little Lies. I was skeptical given her lack of martial arts but it is evident she gave her best during training and for me, her portrayal of Selina was perfect. Chemistry wise though, needed some work between Bats and Cats but nothing worth losing a star over.\n\nMr Dano, wow; Saw like sadist perhaps inspired by Mr Spacey a bit, a Riddler far from the kooky \"riddle me this\" we have come to know and enjoy but he gave in a performance no less than his stellar efforts with Daniel Day Lewis. I have become a fan of Mr Dano\'s acting.\n\nMr Serkis, just when I thought a re-imagining might go awry, there is Mr Serkis. He portrays Alfred so naturally, it\'s as if he is Alfred Pennyworth.\n\nMr Wright is a fair enough Gordon and without any fault of his, once you\'ve seen him as Felix Leiter (as he was the best Leiter for me) it\'s hard to not compare his take on Gordon with Leiter. Also once you\'ve seen Mr Oldman in and as anything...well Mr Oldman is my best Gordon (like Mr Simmons is my best JJJameson).\n\nMr Farrell was a believable budding Cobblepot and I hope he brings the same effort to the supposed spinoff (suffice to say I also had enjoyed his take on Bullseye..but InBruges is till my best for Mr Farrell).\n\nMr Turturro is limited but still impactful as was Mr Skarsgard.\n\nDirection/Plot - I appreciate good work and Mr Reeves clearly put in an honest effort. I enjoyed his vision and never felt bored or distracted whilst watching his movie. He is not Mr Nolan or Mr Burton or Mr Timm/Mr Dini, but a league of his own and in this, he owned it. Thank you for not messing it up.\n\nStory wise the movie is entertaining and well made - there is a threat, hero and allies must work to show their relevance and save the day - done quite effectively (not life changing but films rarely are, however storytelling is meaningful). Obviously production values are impressive and the cinematography is amazing. Set designs are useful while costumes are well thought out and used relevantly.\n\nOverall - 10 out of 10 from me.\n\nVinaka from Fiji.'),(712,41,'10/10','The Batman','gabrielpearson','1 March 2022','Robert Pattinson is great, I loved this film but if you\'re reading reviews don\'t listen to metacritic they are awful.

Matt Reeves and Peter Craig really are a skilled writer set and the plot, the dialogues and even the humor are sharply written! Kudos to both of them. The score of the movie is amazing! Please do not listen to it before the movie. You need to hear and see the combination of visuals and the movie. It\'s full on amazing. Michael Giacchino has perfectly crafted a score for ages. In certain scenes I could feel my excitement and my adrenaline pump just because of the score. It\'s a very long movie, so it really does take its time in developing the story and the characters. I found myself liking the first 2/3s a bit more than the final stretch but overall it was amazingly told from start to finish.\n\nThe visuals, fight scenes and the camera work is very well crafted too. There\'s no shaky cam scenes, no fight scene is shot too close. And one particular scene had my jaw dropping.\n\nI tried to avoid all the trailers and promo material to not spoiler the movie for me so I kind of went in not knowing and from the opening the movie turned out to be way darker than I expected it to be. But it\'s a good thing honestly and I am full on with it if it turns out to be a trilogy. And with that said people will try to compare it to TDK which in my opinion isn\'t fair because TDK was the second Part in a trilogy. This movie here should be compared to Batman Begins. And to answer the question. Yes I think it\'s better than Batman begins. And if Matt reeves can keep up the good writing and really develop the story even more we might have a better overall trilogy of Batman!\n\nAnd one more thing which I find very important. Since the movie is rated PG-13 i would still advise parents to have a second thought about taking younger children to the movies. It\'s a very dark movie and very intense.

Such is the case with director Matthew Vaughn\'s latest, an action-adventure/comedy about an author of spy novels (Bryce Dallas Howard) who stumbles into a real-life espionage scenario that matches the plot of her latest novel, embroiling her in a web of ever-shifting intrigue with various nefarious parties. The problem here is that the film never quite latches onto a dedicated focus to make the picture work. Some of the comic bits are indeed quite funny, but they frequently get bogged down by a meandering story line that\'s trying to follow a more conventional, twist-laden thriller format. It leaves viewers asking, \"So what\'s it going to be?\" There\'s also more than a little derivative material thrown in, such as story threads we\'ve already seen before in movies like \"Romancing the Stone\" (1984), \"The Long Kiss Goodnight\" (1996) and any number of James Bond flicks. While it\'s true that this release is intended to be a spoof of these titles (especially in scenes featuring Henry Cavill as a hilariously hammy 007 knock-off), there\'s a big difference between paying tribute and playing unrepentant copycat. Then there\'s the picture\'s excessive length, coming in at a bloated 2:19:00 runtime, far longer than it needs to be, a failing attributable to an often-needlessly complicated plot, one that begins to try audience patience at times, especially in the back half. \"Argylle\" also features a cute, cuddly cat, Alfie, as a central character (at least in its trailer), but, like the narrative overall, the film doesn\'t quite seem to know what to do with the supposedly frisky, fickle feline, an impression far different from what\'s conveyed in the picture\'s video marketing. All of this is a shame, because this title has both potential and some apparent strengths going for it, such as a fine soundtrack, superbly choreographed action sequences, and an excellent ensemble cast with the likes of Sam Rockwell, Bryan Cranston, Catherine O\'Hara, Ariana DeBose, and a seriously underused Richard E. Grant, not to mention fine turns from Howard and Cavill as alter-egos of one another. This one isn\'t nearly as bad as many critics have made it out to be, but it could have been substantially better with some significant retooling and judicious editing. \"Argylle\" apparently has ambitions to become a new franchise, too, but we\'ll have to see if that materializes based on what kind of box office draw it ultimately produces. At this point, though, I think it has its work cut out for it.'),(726,42,'6/10','Alfie the Cat','jack_o_hasanov_imdb','10 February 2024','There are some movies to which you give 6 or 5 points. But you enjoy the film and find it entertaining. This is one of those films. The movie is extremely entertaining. I had a great time at the cinema. Yes, the effects in the film are terrible; yes, it is a parody; and yes, it is ridiculous. However, it was also absurdly funny and silly. I enjoyed it very much. As a movie, I believe it is average, but not bad. Of course, there are numerous clichés in the film. Many things could have been predicted. By the way, the film is a total twist show. Twists occur one after another, just like in spy films. I lost the seriousness of the movie in the first half hour of the movie. I started enjoying it. The acting isn\'t perfect, but I think it\'s spot-on for this movie. I have never seen Bryce Dallas Howard in this kind of role before. It suits her. They also made a great duo with Sam Rockwell. The action scenes in the movie are like those in the \"Kingsman\" movies, and the director is Matthew Vaughn, who directed those movies too. I didn\'t fully understand the mid-credit scene of the movie, but if the second movie comes out, I will definitely go. I have no objection to this movie being a series. One of the reasons I like the movie so much is the cat. Alfie, the cat, has many roles in the movie. I don\'t know which scenes were real and which scenes were CGI (a few were definitely CGI), but it was very funny and entertaining.'),(727,42,'5/10','What are you doing to me, Matthew?','FeastMode','2 February 2024','Matthew Vaughn is one of my favorite directors. He has three movies that are on my all-time favorites list: Kick-Ass, X-Men: First Class, and Kingsman: The Secret Service. I love his style and consider him a master filmmaker.\n\nHis last movie, The King\'s Man, was terrible. I gave it 2 stars. But no one is perfect and it\'s easy to forgive one misfire. But with Argylle, we have another severely disappointing entry. It\'s not nearly as bad as The King\'s Man, but that might be why it\'s even more disappointing. It could have been great.\n\nWhy doesn\'t Argylle work? Movies are so complex, it\'s difficult to answer that question. Here are my guesses. First, the humor and attempts to be quirky feel off. I only laughed once. Second, there are a few cool action scenes, but nothing to write home about.\n\nThird, what idiot decided this should be PG-13? There are so many deaths, but they can\'t fully show it. So it feels neutered. They do this to sell more tickets, catering to the casuals. But my theater was nearly empty on opening night. So casuals didn\'t show up and you alienate your true fans. Fourth, for what amounts to a popcorn flick, I was fairly bored and unengaged.\n\nBut I think one thing hurt the movie more than anything else. This is a great cast except for one role. The most important one. The main character. I don\'t dislike Bryce Dallas Howard. But this was a horrendous casting choice. I can list out 30 actresses that would have been better suited for the role. It doesn\'t seem too bad early on, but the further we get into the story, the worse it gets. It\'s not even a tiny bit believable.\n\nI still look forward to future Matthew Vaughn projects. But I just found out that his next movie is a sequel to The King\'s Man. Why????? I can only hope he reevaluates and tries to get back on track.\n\n(1 viewing, opening Thursday UltraScreen 2/1/2024)'),(728,42,'7/10','Argylle - It\'s really dumb, but it\'s also fun.','shayenu','31 January 2024','Have you ever watched a movie thats so absurd and brainless that it actually works? Argylle belongs to that group - as Matthew Vaughns latest is gladly a crowd-pleasing action flick that is full of smart twists and epic action sequences. There\'s no doubt that it does get ridicule at times, with huge logic gaps and absurdity - but this movie embraces its silliness, dedicating its writing to plot-twists that are so well thought out that you would never guess them coming - making Argylle an action movie that stands out enough to be enjoyable.\n\nWhen the movie started rolling, I at first couldn\'t get invested in its storyline. The narrative seemed generic andd full of irrefutable plot holes. However, I remembered Matthew Vaughns genius. What he sold us in Kick Ass and Kingsman were ridiculously entertaining and thoughtful action flicks, and I had hope Argylle was going to turn in to the same - and boy, it did. The best aspect of this movie is, no doubt, its incredible and provocative plot-twists which really add this sense of unpredictability to this film and keeps you smiling always. These really start to kick off from the half-hour mark - whenever you predict whats about to happen, we get the total opposite - and there\'s clever hints skillfully layered around foreshadowing and setting up these twists to make you smile when they happen. It\'s definitely arguable from another perspective that they aren\'t justified enough, as they do question more potential plot holes - however this is what adds to the unpredictability and distinct nature of this movie\n\nThe ensemble cast also just adds to the fun. Everyone does a great job, but Sam Rockwell\'s character is the most entertaining and easiest to root for.\n\nThis fun isn\'t without its issues, though - as its main one is its lack of any emotion or layers within our characters. They are often unconvincing and bland, with the only form of character dynamics coming from our protagonist and their partner in crime. Apart from that though, we have no reason to care for our characters, any of them in particular. The CGI is often horrific at times too. It shows its decency in some fight-scenes, but in others it is truly appalling.\n\nUltimately, and despite the movies issues, Argylle and It\'s absurd plot (that I don\'t want to talk about as there are just too many twists!) will keep all audiences engaged, purely thanks to Vaughn and the writing teams genius plot-twists that make this movie one to definitely check out, standing out from the hoard of movies in its genre. And thats just what we need from it, especially in this day and age where politics and global issues distract us from having a good time!'),(729,42,'7/10','Not plausible, but a laugh out loud silly spy movie','malmevik77','2 February 2024','Argylle\n\nA very hyped movie from the writer of the Kingsman series, the trailer frequently showed moments of silliness, spy action, Bryce Dallas Howard screaming and a cat that\'s supposedly awesome or something. At first the movie is cheesy as can be, but it does appear that is intentional. Most of the movie leads the audience to believe it is one thing, when it really is another, being revealed in surprise twists that aren\'t very surprising.\n\nThe ensemble cast does feature some great performances, even though Henry Cavill\'s hair is absolutely terrible. Dua Lipa\'s appearance is short, but she does a great job that it made me miss seeing her. Sam Rockwell continues a trend in Hollywood where age can be defied as I forgot he is in his mid 50s following the likes of Tom Cruise and Jason Statham.\n\nThe movie is way too long and needed a better editor. I like a fleshed out story as much as the next person, but calm down movie.\n\nNow, on to the fun. This movie makes the word \"ridiculous\" woefully inadequate. But it\'s a fun ridiculous. There are so many laugh out loud moments that it makes up for a lot of the flaws. I don\'t want to spoil the movie, but keep an eye out for the blink and you\'ll miss it hilarity.\n\nThere are themes explored in this film about motivation, and whether the emotions experienced during life\'s choices, even when told in the format of a spy thriller, would carry over if you got to do it all over again. Personally, I find that theory worth exploring, because I wonder if I\'d make the same good or bad decisions if not exposed to certain stimuli or experiences. Nature vs nurture anyone? People admit that they would love to be able to speak to their younger selves to assure them that things would be better eventually, or to avoid pitfalls, but that\'s not good enough. One never knows if that would make any difference, unless you take away those moments.\n\nI enjoyed the heck out of this movie overall, and recommend it for the silliness alone. Don\'t take the movie seriously, and I believe you will too.

From fantastical action and good one liners it turns into a snore fest with redundant, lengthy scenes trying to establish some sense of emotional gravitas. Problem is, BDH has zero range, and became nothing but annoying and downright bad at what she was supposed to after.\n\nSecondly, it bacame clear that it was style over substance. Which I one hundred percent can support, if the style is cool, creative, innovative, fun, esthetically pleasing. It never fully was, and it never really committed, becoming a jigsaw of puzzle pieces forced together that really did not fit.\n\nThirdly, under utilized actors. Lots of great small roles, none got to shine, and especially SLJ had one of his worst roles for years, mostly reduced to acting like an excited 5 yo in the end.\n\nIn the end, the movie was somewhat saved by an always fun and excellent Sam Rockwell.

In other words, it\'s the standard modern day Hollywood movie. Some aspects are fun but the whole thing drags on and on until you\'ll be checking your watch every five minutes in hopes that it will be over soon. There is an abundance of CGI and a lot of it is terrible(especially the cat) and it makes the movie look fake but that\'s the norm these days. I\'m not even sure if they filmed any scenes in London because the exterior shots looked really bad to me. Some of the hand to hand combat is pretty decent but for the most part I didn\'t care about what was happening at all. Additionally, some of the twists in this worked but overall it just kept doing more and more of them and became a convoluted wreck.\n\nFurthermore, the trailers and posters for this film straight up lie. They have you believe that Henry Cavill will be the star of the movie but he\'s in this for all of maybe five minutes at most. Those five minutes prove that he would be a great James Bond but I bet that will never happen because why make the correct choice and cast someone that is perfect for a role. Additionally, John Cena is in this for even less time and it makes me wonder why they even bothered casting him as he must\'ve cost them a fair amount of money for what amounts to a cameo. The rest of the cast is fine and I like Sam Rockwell so it\'s nice to see him in a leading role. On the other hand, the comedy doesn\'t land at all and no one in my screening was laughing at any of the jokes. I think think the PG-13 rating hurts the movie by making it too tame and making it Rated R would\'ve helped it a bit.. If this thing was made in the 90s it would\'ve been much prettier, shorter, bloodier and most importantly, more fun. Argylle, however is just nonsensical, looks awful and overstays its welcome.'),(737,42,'7/10','This Movie is Wild','kjproulx','2 February 2024','Matthew Vaughn has always been a director I have admired. Whether you are talking about his earlier works in Layer Cake or Stardust, or his over-the-top action films in Kick-Ass or The Kingsman films, I have never disliked his work until recently. It was not until 2021\'s The King\'s Man that I found his work to feel a little stale. That film didn\'t work for me on many levels, but I have either liked or loved the rest of his filmography otherwise. Well, you can put Argylle down as another one of his that I liked. There has been a lot of criticism, but I do not fully agree with it.\n\nThis is going to be a difficult one to describe without sounding confusing, but I will give it a go. Elly Conway (Bryce Dallas Howard) is a novelist who has written a book series known as Argylle. What she does not realize is that the events of the book have actually happened in reality and continue to happen in real-time as she writes her next sequel. In comes Aidan Wilde (Sam Rockwell), a spy who shows up to protect Elly and takes her on a crazy adventure, avoiding a real-life spy organization out to get her. While this plot goes on, Elly sees visions of the main character in her book, Argylle (Henry Cavill), who helps her both keep and lose focus on her tasks. What I will say is that this film did not market itself well.\n\nAudiences see Henry Cavill, Dua Lipa, and John Cena all over the posters and trailers, but in reality, they collectively have about 10-20 minutes of screen time in a film that is nearly two and a half hours long. Some viewers will be bothered by this so I thought I would mention it, but the fact is, I love both Sam Rockwell and Bryce Dallas Howard and I thoroughly enjoyed their chemistry together here, so I was easily able to forgive that. Where I will complain about the film though, is the fact that it tries to be too clever for its own good. Once something is revealed to the audience as a twist, another twist or two is layered within that twist, and then another few twists are just around the corner. It kept me on the edge of my seat and made it impossible to predict what was coming next (even though I kind of predicted the ending), which was nice, it was just too much all at once.\n\nAside from the ridiculous amount of twists, this film (aside from the opening action sequences) has a fun story and quite a bit of action, especially in the last act. With that said though, as long as you are in for anything (as I was being a Matthew Vaughn fan), the last 30 minutes are just simply wild. Once the main plot twist occurs in the film, it becomes a completely different experience and it shifts gears into silliness, but because I like how Vaughn does silly, I was still in for the ride. I also liked the second Kingsman film, so I know this one won\'t be for everyone. Simply put, this film is too much, but it was too much of a bunch of things I enjoyed watching, so I can\'t be overly harsh here. In my opinion, Argylle is a good time and I recommend it, but be aware it gets pretty bonkers.'),(738,42,'7/10','Fur-tunately, this isn\'t a Cat-astrophe. It was Purr-fect for a movie released in February.','iamianiman','31 January 2024','Packed in a way that is engaging, Argylle offers a story that felt rather simple. But as you went further and further into it, it became something more than that. You will become more intrigued. Your interest in the movie will be better. It will be anything beyond your expectations. They surprise you with the storytelling, it became soooo interesting halfway through the movie. What started as an \'okay\' premise turned into something captivating that got really interesting.\n\nThere\'s a certain appeal we like with the way the story was told. They\'re good at containing and revealing the surprise elements. They knew how to structure the story. It was exciting knowing that the scriptwriters and directors knew what they\'re doing. We felt that the script was polished from time to time, tightening loose ends and only when it\'s ready that they started to greenlight the production.\n\nHowever, the third act felt... a bit too much. The beginning of the story had this blend of normality and ridiculousness. It was a great combination but the second act came in and it got interesting but slightly replicated the world of Kingsman. But came the third act and it was wayyyy too ridiculous, even more ridiculous than Kingsman I would say. The tone just fell apart there. It became too cartoon-ish, we wondered, \'What happened to all the logics they had established in the beginning?\'. If only the beginning was a bit more boisterous in its tone, we could have enjoyed more of the third act.\n\nAnother thing that Argylle suffers from is that for a movie this ridiculous, it just doesn\'t have that much energy to supplement the tone and action portrayed. It became increasingly weirder and ridiculous but the thing is, the energy was flat, if not, increased only mildly. If you felt kinda numb watching the action scenes or you felt that they did everything right but you still felt that something was off or missing, then yeap, it\'s the energy that\'s lacking. Kingsman had a vibrant energy and that\'s what made it a very good film, it jived with the tone of the film. This one, not so much.\n\nIts strong lies in the dynamic of almost every character, particularly the main leads played by Bryce Dallas Howard & Sam Rockwell. These two carried the movie with the support of the whole cast. Bryce and Sam really shined through and through, delivering performances that stay true to what their characters are supposed to suggest to the audience. They are the leads but they don\'t necessarily have to be charming or elegant. They don\'t need to be on par with the beauty standards set in Hollywood because their characters just are not meant to be. Personality wise, both of them have different qualities that made their presence strong when together. Their characters really felt out of place to be the leads but it\'s interesting to have them both put in the situations they\'re in. Ohhh, and the cat is just sooooo purr-fect.\n\nWhile a lot of characters are interesting, we indeed have a problem with one character. The character played by Samuel Jackson. His character was very flat for someone who seemed very important. It wasn\'t fleshed out enough. He barely had any screen time that it won\'t really affect the story if... he\'s not thereeee? For a great actor to have a minimal role and did him dirty while other characters have more significance in their presence for the story is kinda like an insult.\n\nEven Dua Lipa has more screen time than him! Or so we thought according to our calculation. This movie markets Dua Lipa as the supporting character but rest assured, she\'s not. If you guess she\'s here as a cameo, then you\'re right. Her acting was okay at best, but she\'s very pleasing to watch. If only we could get more from her, the movie might have been more fun.\n\nThere\'s a certain cartoon-ish and comical element that comes with the visual effects. But knowing how this movie is going to make us feel and how it\'s going to look like, the imperfect look just became the right fit for this kind of movie, might even be intentional somehow, that they made the CGI looked exactly the way they appeared to be because it jived with the whole Kingsman-like tone since it\'s directed by the same guy.\n\nWe also need to give credits where it\'s due to the people who came with the idea and the people who made it happen. The first 45 mins, especially the train scene has superb transitions. It plays with this element a lot and we could see they had so much fun shooting the scenes. The transitions were hard to do but it was smooth. It\'s something that amplified its entertainment value and we love it.\n\nWhile the story is packaged and told in a fascinating way, we are not eager to head to the theater for a second viewing. In our opinion, this movie doesn\'t have the rewatchability factor. It doesn\'t have the elements to hook us in for a repeat. Action is great but not \'wow\' enough. Comedy is there but was pretty bland. There just wasn\'t anything visually memorable that would want us or we\'re guessing, most audience for a repeated viewing. The only reason to go again if you\'d like to spot all the tiny little details that happened and analyze it better in case you overlooked it during your first viewing. Our advice is, focus on all the little hints this movie is giving you because it is important for the story.\n\nVerdict: What Argylle masters is in its art of crafting its storytelling filled with surprising moments alongside its colourful character dynamics. This Kingsman-like world reflects on and subtly criticizes past action movies tropes in an engaging, somewhat meta manner. Where Argylle lacks is the absurd finale, weak energy and the zilch interest of rewatching it again. But then, Matthew Vaughn again created a world so unique we cannot overlook the fact that this is the most original of a film we can get in 2024.'),(739,42,'1/10','Walk Out Bad','john-05690','26 February 2024','Wow- was this work reviewed by anyone?

Although my friend who accompanied me didn\'t like it, I found the imaginative plot quite engaging. The well-known actors\' performances kept me glued to the screen, even during the cheesy scenes. While the movie may not be a contender for the Oscars, it does provide a few hours of escapism from the real world.\n\nThe only downside for me was that the movie felt a bit too long for its storyline. The movie\'s marketing is quite effective, as the trailer seems to focus on Dua Lipa and Henry Cavill, but their appearances in the film are short. Despite this, both of them did a great job. However, it\'s important to note that they are not the main characters of the movie, as the trailer might suggest.\n\nAll in all, I enjoyed the movie.

In its first half, Argylle shows why this genre can be so entertaining and refreshing, and then the second half explains how terrible it can turn out to be and why it shouldn\'t be made often. There are too many twists, which is actually good, but after a while, it goes over the board, over the head, or whatever you want to call it. \"That\'s the dumbest thing I\'ve ever heard in my life,\" yells Aidan, aka Sam Rockwell, and you are like, \"Yes! Then why the hell do you want us to believe it?\" That\'s what happens with the entire second half of this movie as it goes from A to G to C to Z to T to again back to B. That\'s how MESSY it is. Too many twists make too much of a mess here.\n\nArgylle is about a spy novelist, Elly Conway (Bryce Dallas Howard), who has just finished her fifth book on a fictional agent, Argylle (Henry Cavill). For the next book, she decides to visit her mother, Ruth Conway (Catherine O\'Hara), to brew some new ideas. On the train, she meets a real agent, Aidan (Sam Rockwell), who is on a mission to save her from a gang. Elly constantly imagines Argylle in place of Aidan while he is busy beating the gang and doing everything to save her. Aidan informs Elly that her novels are not fictional but are turning out to be true. She is a hell of a fortune teller, and that\'s why the bad gang is after her to get the hold of a certain master file before the good gang, aka Aidan, can get to it. But that\'s not even half of what you are about to see in the second half, so let\'s not spoil anything because there is a new twist every 10 minutes.\n\nThe writing of Argylle sounds absurd in the first half, but it\'s damn funny. That\'s why you can carry on with it. The idea of merging a fictional agent with a real one and the events was somewhat interesting and was made watchable with a touch of comedy. The problem appears in the second half when you learn the truth about Elly, Aidan, and the gang members, including her parents. Every single theory starts annoying you, and then you get a horrible climax, full of mindless action and senseless ideas. From memory loss to brainwashing to even hypnotism, come on, man, that\'s just way above the line. That\'s too much. Argylle leaves you exhausted with the displeasure of watching 3-4 bad spy movies in that last hour. Can you imagine that?\n\nBryce Dallas Howard as Elly Conway looks cute, but she has a deadly side to show too. Her punchlines don\'t come out as they should, but we can\'t think of any good female comedy statures after Barbie. The idea and standard have both changed now. Sam Rockwell impresses in some scenes and remains steady throughout the film. The handsome agent, Henry Cavill, is all what girls would make noise about. But the role? Let me change the subject. Bryan Cranston and Catherine O\'Hara have a few surprises in store, but the performances aren\'t that good. Ariana DeBose, Dua Lipa, John Cena, and Samuel Jackson enjoy the screen time with their small supportive roles, while Sofia Boutella finds the best space amongst them. Alfie, aka Chip, the cat, will entertain you with her silence, but don\'t be surprised by her claws at the end.\n\nOn the technical front, Argylle seemed okay, with some problems in the sound design. The cinematography was good, and the VFX work on those swipe-to-agents scenes was fantastic. You gotta give some credit to the screenplay writer for visualising those things on paper. It was a new experience, despite its stupidity. We aren\'t complaining about absurd humour here, and nobody minds that until it is making you laugh. Argylle fails to understand where to stop. You just can\'t expect us to believe every unreliable thing coming one after another for over a half hour. Matthew Vaughn\'s vision was too out of the line, too unimaginable, and unconvincing. He could have removed all those bunches of twists in the end and made a simple spy comedy, but he preferred to make it messy, and the results are not what spy movie lovers deserve. As a whole, Vaughan\'s attempt at over-novelization struggles to find the right ideas, so let\'s not open the book this time.\n\nRATING - 3/10*'),(744,42,'1/10','One of the worst thing it can happen to you','dobridin','2 February 2024','The movie is mediocre for the best part.

When you look at the cast you cannot suggest the mockery that is about to follow. Also the entire movie is filmed on a green screen and the CGI was so bad it would be a shame for any average youtuber. I thought that the computer effects really went a long way in the past years but with this is like they have used a technology from the 90ties. The only explanation would be that they blow most of the budget for the cast and only had 20 bucks for everything else.

It mocks the conventions of Bond movies. The plot is completely implausible but it all hangs together, kinda sorta. It involves, of course, international spy conspiracies and lots and lots of twists and turns in exotic locales like London and the south of France.\n\nBryce Dallas Howard manages to play a range of personas of a very complicated character. Sam Rockwell is just adorable as a laid back, super confident, super competent spy. He\'s surprisingly sexy and romantic. Rockwell is not tall and he\'s not particularly muscular and he\'s not super handsome. He radiates scruffy, average guy sexiness in contrast to the tall, muscular, freakishly handsome sexiness of the divine Henry Cavill.\n\nCatherine O\'Hara, Bryan Cranston, Samuel L Jackson, and John Cena are all really good as ... well, I can\'t tell you what they play because that would spoil the outlandish Bond-ish plot. Richard Grant and Ariana DeBose are in the movie only briefly but they are of course wonderful.\n\n\"Argyle\" is violent without being bloody or gory. Anonymous hitman are killed and the body count is high, but you don\'t see any blood. There are martial arts fight scenes. Again, this is a spoof and the violence in these scenes is superficial, but yes, there is a lot of shooting. There\'s a wild shootout scene involving ice skating on a highly unexpected surface - it\'s not ice. I expected the skater to perform \"The Iron Lotus\" from \"Blades of Glory.\"\n\nIf you are in the mood for pure escapist fare that lets you turn off your brain and you just want to watch stars do their stuff and watch exotic locales and a lead couple with good romantic chemistry, \"Argyle\" might be just for you.'),(747,43,'7/10','I Have No Idea Why People Are Bashing This Movie','Workin_Man','7 April 2006','Twister, in my opinion, is a really good action thriller.

The acting is great, the special effects are excellent, the action is intense, and this film actually has a great storyline to it. To me, a 5.9/10 rating for this film is atrocious. I think this film deserves so much better!! I was thinking of somewhere in between a 7 and an 8/10. But I have my opinion and other people have their own right?? I just find it hard to believe that people don\'t like this movie.\n\nTwister has everything I like in an action movie. It has amazing special effects, heart-stopping action, and a reasonably well written storyline. It even has some heartbreaking parts which almost brought tears to my eyes and I don\'t usually cry during movies. However I almost cried during Twister.

I was only 11 when the movie was released and I was absolutely in love with it, in fact right after the movie was done, I wanted to become a storm chaser. That\'s how much I loved this movie; I grew up and forgot about the movie and decided on a new career. But I saw the DVD on sale and thought about how much I enjoyed the movie when I was younger, I\'m sure it would be just as much fun to see it again. I have to say this wasn\'t as awesome as I remembered, in the theater it was like \"Oh, my God! Look at that flying cow! A house just flew across the road! That is so cool!\", now on my TV screen I was like \"Oh, wow, look at that cow. How the heck does a house fly across the road? Why isn\'t this as cool as I remembered it?\" Not to mention that the story wasn\'t as good as I remembered, granted I know that they had to fit in some kind of story with the whole plot of the twisters, but a lot of this movie is just plain unrealistic.\n\nIn June 1969 on an Oklahoma farm a tornado warning is issued, the family seeks shelter in a storm cellar as an F5 tornado strikes. However, the storm is so strong that the locks on the cellar door fail and the father is caught up in the storm and killed as his daughter struggles to catch a glimpse of the powerful storm. Years later, Dr. Jo Harding, the father\'s daughter, is reunited with her estranged husband; Bill Harding. Bill is a former weather researcher and storm chaser who has taken a job as a weather reporter. He is planning to marry his new girlfriend, Dr. Melissa Reeves, and arrives at Jo\'s research lab seeking Jo\'s signature for the final divorce papers. Bill discovers that Jo has built a tornado research device called DOROTHY based upon his own design; the device is designed to release hundreds of sensors into the center of a tornado to study its structure. The team later meets up with Dr. Jonas Miller, a smug and unscrupulous fellow meteorologist and storm chaser. When Bill discovers that Jonas has \"invented\" a device almost identical to DOROTHY; he vows to help Jo deploy DOROTHY before Miller can claim credit for the idea. Bill and Melissa join Jo and her eccentric team of storm chasers. Tensions rise between Jo and Bill when they have several close calls with dangerous tornadoes as they try unsuccessfully to deploy the new device.\n\nSo how does Twister hold up over these years? Not so well, the effects are still amazing, but that\'s about it. I do have to admit, even though it\'s a bad movie, I still enjoy it like crazy. I think because if you let go of how unrealistic it is, you can just have fun with that want of destruction and chaos. Granted I know this movie is a bit stupid: our two leads, Bill and Jo, survive the impossible facing an F5 twister, the twisters always disappear as our \"hero\'s\" are in danger, Bill\'s fiancé puts up with quit a bit before realizing that he is a jerk for putting her through all the danger with him, Jo, a scientist, thinks that tornado\'s are serial killers, and not to mention that this was a record breaking day with numerous twisters. But still as bad as the acting, as bad as the story, as stupid as some of these situations may be, it\'s still a fun movie to watch and I think I wanna be fair with the rating just because it is mindless entertainment. It\'s a classic 90\'s disaster movie and besides, it has flying cows, what other film will give you that kind of situation? But it\'s all good I think they were taking the cows to McDonald\'s anyways.\n\n7/10'),(749,43,'motor89','I like Twister','12 November 2001','Was this review helpful?

It was intended to be a summer blockbuster \"put your brain on hold\" action film when it was released in 1996, and that is what it was and still is. Its competition at the time was \"Independence Day\", which is an unwatchable hokey movie, and this movie is better than that film in that it is a watchable hokey movie. Helen Hunt and Bill Paxton play recently divorced storm chasers Jo and Bill Harding whose relationship was pulled apart by Jo\'s obsession with chasing tornadoes to the exclusion of wanting any kind of \"normal family life\" by Bill\'s definition. Bill has moved on and found a more conventional girl that he plans to marry (Jami Gertz). However, before he can move on, Bill needs Jo to sign some papers. He meets her \"in the field\" as she and her team from the university plan a day of chasing tornadoes through Oklahoma. Before they can conclude their business a storm calls the team to the chase, and Bill is drawn into the chase by necessity but kept there by his latent passion - for storm-chasing and maybe even for the marriage he left behind. The film features some great special effects, fast-paced action, and cringingly obvious dialog with the subtlety of a sledgehammer. However if you\'re just in the mood for an action-packed film with a feel-good after effect, this movie fits the bill.\n\nThe current rating of 6/10 is probably correct if you are comparing Twister with Casablanca.

However, that\'s what it\'s SUPPOSED to be! If you go to see this movie, don\'t expect an Oscar-winning film. It\'s a very simple plot (No spoilers): A group of storm chasers are tracking a huge front spawning multiple tornadoes throughout Oklahoma, hoping to test a new weather sensory device that could possibly help with tornado warning systems. To complicate things, the former leader of the group (Bill Paxton) has come back to have his ex-wife and current supervisor of the team (Helen Hunt) sign the final divorce papers. However, he finds himself swept up (no pun intended) in joining the chase again. That\'s pretty much it; not outrageous nor all that thought provoking.\n\nThe actors are all reputable (Paxton, Hunt, Elwes, Hoffman, Ruck, etc) and very good in their roles and they work well with the somewhat weak dialog, and the special effects are very good. Also, the physics are relatively accurate; I can\'t really think of any groan-inducing actions scenes.

Where I live an inch of rain is headline news. I had absolutely no interest in Twister until I saw it was on late one boring night. Having nothing better to do, I obliged the television and payed attention. I found Twister to be what I call a nice bedtime movie. While it failed to anthropomorphize the tornado the way Backdraft successfully did with fire, the characters were well fleshed out, there was a healthy balance of comedy, drama and (at the time) cutting edge special FX. I found that as long as the viewer came in with no expectation, Twister would be a fun and easy to watch nappy time movie, perfect for watching on a rainy day, curled up with a blanket. So to sum everything up, don\'t expect an epic, emotionally charged extravaganza, but if you are willing to accept a decently woven story with reasonably believable characters, and have a rainy afternoon to kill, check out Twister.

All movies on the genre to follow would be compared to these.\n\n\'Twister\' is one of the best disaster movies. The destruction and action sequences are very well done, accompanied by incredibly realistic visuals. The film gives a nice insight into the lives of storm chasers. In \'Twister\', separated husband and wife team designed a system that would allow them to predict severe weather patterns. The only problem is that they need to get close enough to a twister in order to allow hundreds of sensors to be sucked up into the funnel. Thus, they chase one storm after the other hoping to succeed.\n\nAdd a nice dose of humor, some drama elements, and total mayhem and destruction and you have a hell of an entertaining action adventure drama, with a bit of suspense in the mix as well.\n\nMy only criticism would be that the actors\' reactions didn\'t always look realistic considering the situations they found themselves in, and massive destruction all around them. Even though the characters are professional storm chasers, they must surely still believe things could go terribly wrong when confronted by nature. Instead, they sometimes make fun of a situation, even when life-threatening. The expression on their faces also didn\'t always convince me they were in fact faced with danger - maybe this was because the actors didn\'t have anything to work with, since all the visuals were added during post-production. The sad fact of CGI and actors having to work on instinct...\n\nAh, well, that aside, \'Twister\' is an amazing movie and one of my favorite disaster movies.'),(761,43,'7/10','Sucks and blows - \"Twister\"','dee.reid','6 November 2005','You don\'t play with Mother Nature.

In \"Twister,\" Nature is given a frightening new dimension courtesy of breathtaking Hollywood CGI effects but it\'s dumbed down by a questionable script and dialogue (thanks to none other than novelist Michael Crichton himself as a co-author, along with wife Anne-Marie Martin) and sub-par acting. Sure, a number of liberties are also taken with tornadoes (\"fingers of God\" - one character calls them), but what do you expect from a film directed by \"Speed\" Jan de Bont?\n\nAnd lastly, who goes to see movies like this for scientific accuracy? I remember watching it with a friend and giving him a nasty tongue-lashing afterwards for his redundant pointing out of the various scientific and factual inaccuracies that abound in it (which he told me had each been identified by his science teacher - go figure). I snapped back, \"Dude, chill out. It\'s just a movie. Who cares if this does or doesn\'t happen, or tornadoes don\'t suck like that.\" I basically told him to get a grip.\n\nNature is unrepentant in its desire to test human will to withstand her destructive forces. I showered praise on \"Twister\" for capturing that and making sure its human characters realize it. I make these statements because \"Twister\" is quite terrifying in its scenes of tornadoes blazing paths of destruction, and this is what people tend to miss when watching it. I know I\'m sure to run into flak because of it but, what am I going to do {*shrugs shoulders*}?\n\nAs the film opens on the plains of Oklahoma\'s Tornado Alley, the National Weather Service is tracking several storm systems that if they were to merge any time soon, they could see a record outbreak of violent, tornado-producing severe weather. Next, we\'re introduced to meteorologist and recent divorcée Bill (Bill Paxton) and fiancée Melissa (Jami Gertz) - \"She\'s a reproductive therapist,\" he reassures us, after Bill is asked if she is HIS therapist. Melissa isn\'t too keen on the idea of storm chasing, which poses a problem for them both, but for Bill it was always the thrill of the hunt, and we know he\'s not going to pass the opportunity to get back in the mode of things.\n\nWe then arrive at a field where we meet the storm chasers, led by Bill\'s tough ex and fellow meteorologist Jo (Helen Hunt), who has somehow mysteriously forgotten to sign her name to the last page of the divorce papers (she still loves him). When asked if he\'s back by the various supporting players, he emphatically denies he has returned to his field of expertise. But it turns out, however, that before their marriage went to hell, they had been busy developing a revolutionary storm system-tracking device that could give them the inside knowledge of how tornadoes work.\n\n\"DOROTHY\" (real original), the miracle device, a package that contains hundreds of little sensors, could be placed in the damage path and each sensor could provide a detailed map of a tornado\'s inner-workings and with such knowledge now available, they could design an advanced warning system. The trick is, however, they have to wait until a twister spawns, place Dorothy in its damage path (or \"Suck Zone\"), and then run like hell. The action begins when they\'re forced to take off to chase after the storm, and it\'s about here the film abandons logic and plot for nonstop special effects, peril, and destruction.\n\nSaying the acting here sucks and is uninspired is like saying we went to see \"Jurassic Park\" (1993) for the performances - understatement - get real. It\'s easy for any casual movie-goer to pick apart bad acting and lousy story, but come on, it\'s a roller coaster film. I\'m not sure I could put it in clearer writing for you about how we don\'t go to see movies like this for Oscar-winning actors or plot. I\'ve always liked Bill Paxton (who I personally see as probably being the next Clint Eastwood), and I find it difficult about how he has somehow managed to avoid stardom. Here, his character seems to know how the storm functions and what it \"thinks,\" and in essence he\'s a human barometer (even his wild days as a radical storm chaser do deserve some laughs).\n\nThe writing is substandard, including Jo\'s barely-hinted upon obsession with chasing the storm (as a child, she saw her dad killed by a monster F5), Lois Smith as Jo\'s Aunt Meg (who supplies our famished heroes with platters of beef and eggs between effects scenes), the underdeveloped storm chasing team (some of whom are more colorful than others, including Philip Seymour Hoffman as Dusty), and the unnecessary subplot involving stiff competition from Cary Elwes as a corporate-sponsored rival who stole Bill\'s invention. But this isn\'t too glaring a problem, if you\'re a hard-a** for art in cinema and came to \"Twister\" expecting it. You\'ll see plenty scenes of destruction (just wait for the drive-in showing \"The Shining\"), and the music that swells up when tornadoes appear.\n\nLastly, I can see how anyone who has experienced a twister in their lives could probably want to possibly stay from \"Twister.\" I\'ve never seen one and I don\'t want to. I do know people who have experienced tornadoes; in northern Virginia, where I live, we rarely see the kind of severe weather that produces twisters, but my grandparents, who live close to me, were once in an F1 and thankfully it caused minimal damage to their property and neighbors.\n\n\"Twister\" isn\'t a failure; it\'s a simple realization of the popcorn blockbuster. Put aside the hard-pressing of art, turn off your brain, and enjoy (but you should still watch out for those flying cows, tanker trucks, and other debris that can become a hostile projectile if picked up by a tornado\'s winds); it\'s that simple.\n\n7/10'),(762,43,'10/10','Fun Movie','movieguy81007','7 May 2008','Twister is a fun movie to watch.

It stars two b-grade actors, who prove again here they should not be handed the reigns of an expensive movie (Bill Paxton, Helen Hunt). But to be fair the script is lamer than any script has ever been in all of recorded time. What am I saying? Paxton and Hunt are terrible.\n\nShe\'s a tornado researcher who just happens to have a very standard Hollywood backstory: Dad, you see, was eaten by a tornado, and now she has a grudge, umm, scratch that; she has a weird Oedipal, erotic fixation with tornadoes that makes her trance out and walk towards them like a blond zombie. Uhm... sure. Conveniently this background and volition are explained, as I\'ve never seen before, in a flashback. (< withering sarcasm) Moving along...\n\nThe tornado team you\'re supposed to root for is a bunch of unlikeable nerds played by unlikeable people (none moreso than Phillip Seymour Hoffman) who are prone to phony, over-directed cheerful outbursts. Each new scene that featured them, made me wish for a genre switch from \"disaster movie\" to \"R-rated blood bath.\" I would have had my own outburst (of applause) if they had all been sliced open by heavy machinery in the middle of one of their asinine conversations.\n\nHowever the worst, dumbest, most excruciating part of this turd is that it presents a rival team of tornado researchers as the villain. (Y\'know like high school basketball..?) Bill Paxton actually has to deliver the line (I\'m paraphrasing): \"Jonas (head of \"Team Bad guy\") has no instincts, he sought corporate funding and he\'s in it FOR THE MONEY!\" Sure, he\'s in meteorology for the money, not for the love of low pressure zones. I think at this point a few veins burst in my head.\n\nJamie Gertz was apparently supposed to function as the woman who might draw Bill Paxton out of Helen Hunt\'s clutches, but the writers did the usual \"Let\'s make her a drag, so that when she has to go, the audience isn\'t upset.\" They actually make this device even more desperate, by having HER deliver the \"We\'re finished\" speech. Relievedly... she\'s OK with it. Gosh that resolved itself nicely. I\'m glad I wasn\'t asked to feel any tension related to human emotions in this movie. Not since Sean Young excused herself out of the plot in \"Cousins\" has a scene designed to erase conflict so infuriatingly failed to erase conflict.\n\nDo you know what\'s at least as entertaining as watching tornadoes break things; watching a good script resolve things intelligently or a great script do it cleverly... & being trusted by writers who don\'t assume you\'re an idiot.\n\nMaking the proceedings that much sadder is the fact that the special effects are actually less thrilling than the low-tech canvas sock they used for a tornado in 1939 for the Wizard of Oz (!).\n\nThis movie immediately appeared in a scene-for-scene TV ripoff with Bruce Campbell, called imaginatively \"Tornado\" that somehow made the whole thing even stupider, with expensive tornado sequences happening off screen during the commercials. That z-grade solution at least made me laugh.\n\nThis unredeemable slop should only be shown in the rural sector.'),(766,44,'6/10','Honestly not bad','ksgillihan','19 February 2024','This film isn\'t going to win any Oscars or be nominated by any stretch of the imagination but it\'s a solid action flick. It\'s an interesting take on a military action movie where the drone operator (Crowe) can be the difference between life and death for an American team behind enemy lines. Of course some Hollywood magic carries the movie through scenes that wouldn\'t otherwise happen in real life but that\'s to be expected.\n\nCrowe does a great job as an aging drone operator who should be higher in rank by now but is held back by his own stubbornness. Without Crowe in this role I think the movie would fall far under the radar (pun intended) of most people looking for a decent action movie to watch. Hemsworth does a decent job in his role but it\'s Crowe that holds the film together. Worth a watch.\n95 out of 111 found this helpful. Was this review helpful?

This movie delivers your monies worth too, in my opinion Will Smith and Martin Larwence make such a great team that part of the fun is just watching these two get into it from time to time. And with Michael Bay directing, you know you\'re going to get some good action scenes. Let\'s face it, Bad Boys II has one of the best car chase scenes ion recent history, it dominates the dismal over played chase in Matrix Reloaded which was the other big summer sequel of that year. I think all that needs to be said here in a retort is the movie is an action movie ans needs to be looked at as an action movie. To hell with the elements that the Academy looks at, appreciate the film for all the stuff that blows up and the laughs the cast can bring you to.'),(786,45,'8/10','Over the top, trigger happy macho nonsense. I loved it!','ExpendableMan','21 March 2007','It must be awesome being Michael Bay. I mean, can you imagine any other director who is given mega-budgets every few weeks and told to blow up more than he did in his previous movies? In the first Bad Boys film an air-plane hanger was blown to bits and was swiftly followed by an asteroid being nuked in Armageddon and the destruction of Pearl Harbour in...uh, Pearl Harbour. Not to be undone, Bad Boys 2 has him indulging in not one, but two chaotic car chases where muscle cars which most of us would spend our lives saving up for are torn to pieces like yesterday\'s newspapers and rounding everything up by detonating a sizable part of Cuba. If this trend continues, there won\'t be a building left standing in the whole of North America once Transformers is through. Not bad for a smug little geek with a rubbish haircut.\n\nIf you\'ve seen the first Bad Boys film, you\'ll know what to expect. Will Smith and Martin Lawrence return as Mike Lowrey and Marcus Burnett, a pair of loose cannon cops whose only similarities are their penchants for arguing and getting into gun fights. Lowrey (Smith) is all laid back cool, stylin\' and profilin\' his way through the Miami underworld while charming the pants off every woman that crosses his path. Burnett on the other hand is an insecure, neurotic and over protective family man. Not only that, but he has a bit of an anger management problem as well and has been half a step away from a severe nervous breakdown for the majority of his adult life. So far, so very similar to any cop orientated buddy movie you\'ve ever seen, but Bad Boys 2 overcomes the total lack of originality thanks to the natural charisma of the stars and the sheer spectacle of its action sequences.\n\nThe plot of course is throw away guff designed to hurtle Smith and Lawrence into the thick of as many explosions as possible, but when they bounce off each other this well it\'s difficult to care. Martin Lawrence has never been a great leading man but somehow, when partnered with Will Smith his career makes perfect sense, his manic edginess being the perfect foil to Smith\'s effortless charm. You could argue that being on screen with the World\'s Most Charismatic Man would make anyone look good, but then you\'d clearly not have seen the terrible I, Robot, where nobody looked good. Not even the robot.\n\nAnd then you have the aforementioned action sequences. Yes, we all know they\'re going to be over the top, but lord almighty, it\'s still an adrenaline pumping thrill to see them happen. The opening John Woo impression with the Ku Klux Klan is just the starter to a main course that consists of a destruction derby car chase, a close quarters battle with some Rastafarian gang members, a fist fight on a train carriage, ANOTHER insane car chase and a dessert set in Cuba, where a mansion gets destroyed. Throughout, bodies fly off overpasses to go crashing into glass phone boxes, men are riddled with machine gun fire and the balls of fire get bigger and more firey the later they appear. Bad Boys 2 might not be subtle, but it sure as hell is fun.\n\nHowever, there is a drawback: the running time. It might be an energetic exercise in flashy excess, but did it really need to be two and a half hours long? Entertaining though it is, there comes a point when you\'ve seen enough faceless henchmen getting holes drilled in them and just want to see the villain being brought down. Given the extreme running time, isn\'t also a bit unusual that Joe Pantoliano\'s role as the best clichéd police chief in movie history is so small? Maybe they were worried he\'d pack the movie into his bags and run off with them like he did the first time around...\n\nThose grumbles aside, there\'s little complaint to be made about Bad Boys 2. Sure, it\'s so shallow that I could just as easily have written \"Will Smith and Martin Lawrence destroy stuff\" and summed up the entire enterprise, but it makes for an exhilarating action movie and the natural successor to all those ones produced in the eighties when brain cells were exchanged for body counts and biceps. Try not to take it seriously and you\'ll have a blast.'),(787,45,'7/10','Woosah!','james-jones180','24 January 2020','Bad Boys II takes everything the last film did and ups it to the next level. The action is fast paced and a lot of fun without being too ridiculous. The comedic pairing of Smith and Lawrence is even better here because of the time that\'s past to make their relationship feel more authentic. Unfortunately, the film\'s runtime is also increased by nearly 30 minutes from the previous film and its mostly unnecessary filler moments that feel like they don\'t have much bearing on the actual plot. Granted a couple of these scenes are fun (we all love that Reggie scene) but most just bring the film to a crawl.\n10 out of 12 found this helpful. Was this review helpful?

And Joe Pantoliano makes every movie better. The two funniest scenes are when Burnett and Lowery are scaring the hell out of Burnett\'s daughter\'s date and after the chase scene with the dead bodies and Captain Howard goes off on the two.

The two cops paired together are absolutely hilarious, with Lawrence being slightly older than Smith in real life and the movie giving him a bit of an older brother vibe on screen who in this movie almost constantly considers retiring early or transferring to a different partner when Lowrey does something spectacular as a cop. Their chemistry is fabulous though, and it carries over to the rest of the cast including Burnett\'s younger sister Syd, who is also in law enforcement. Syd is played by Gabrielle Union (Bring It On). Also in Bad Boys II are Captain Howard played by veteran actor and sometimes funnyman Joe Pantoliano (The Matrix), and Detective Marco Vargas played by Jason Manuel Olazabal. Both thespians put forward solid performances and are convincing in their roles as law enforcers. Bad Boys II centers around drugs in the Miami area and how Lowrey and Burnett will take charge busting the operation. Drug kingpin Johnny Tapia, played admirably by Jodi Molla, has to constantly shift his business around the Miami area to avoid being apprehended by the police until very late in the movie. I don\'t want to go into too much detail about what happens then to spoil the ending for you, but let\'s just say that it, especially the drawn out conclusion, is very exciting!! That\'s one thing you can always count on with Jerry Bruckheimer produced movies, is a very exciting movie and Bad Boys II does not fail in this respect!! The action in the movie is outstanding, whether it\'s shootouts between Lowrey, Burnett and the bad guys, or fist fights between our favorite two cops and the bad guys!! There are chase scenes galore, director Michael Bay made the streets of Miami his personal playground by including at least two outstanding chase scenes in the movie!! The acting, especially the comedy that I have previously mentioned is very good!! The directing is great, and the orchestral music and live soundtrack to the film make Bad Boys II a fun movie to see!! The costuming in Bad Boys II is very good and the film nicely sets up a Bad Boys III. The movie is the type that should be enjoyed by family and/or friends on either a weeknight or weekend by adults, as the film is not for the children. 7 out of 10 stars!!'),(795,45,'1/10','Disgraceful','BroadswordCallinDannyBoy','3 September 2005','A huge budget sequel to the dumb \"Bad Boys.\" I guess it was inevitable.\n\nI saw the HBO special on this movie and watch how Will Smith, Michael Bay, and Jerry Bruckheimer went on and on about how great this movie is. What was really happening was that Michael Bay and Will Smith were happy that they received a fat paycheck and Bruckheimer was happy that he will make another huge pile of money with the release.\n\nThey said \"we finally got it perfect.\" Perfect? Perfectly over-blown trash maybe. There is not the slightest distant glimmer of anything that faintly resembles originality here. It is all one boring dull mindless cliché after another until the viewer is literally ready to puke.\n\nThe \"story\" starts with Will Smith, who is hot for Gabrielle Union who is Martin Lawrence\'s sister which is a a cheesy love vs family problem that is addressed so poorly that it shouldn\'t be there. And guess what? There is a twist! Gabrielle Union is an undercover cop working on what maybe the same case! Oh dear! We are also treated to a big loud car chase in which well over thirty vehicles are totaled along with the bad guys. But the good guys? They don\'t even get hurt. Some cops manage to land in critical care, but after flipping over in a car going 80 mph straight into a massive fireball in the middle of the highway you\'d be dead. Yes the T-1000 survived such a feat, but he is a futuristic robot.\n\nMoving right on from the pathetic story and horrible action is the humor. It is also dumb, cliché, and overly vulgar. I mean are rat sex and junior high school level gay jokes something you\'d expect to see in a movie not by John Waters? Types of humor have their placement in film, or as Michael Bay demonstrates so well, misplacement. Moving on we come to a sick excuse for a plot device. Towards the end our heroes got save Gabrielle Union who was kidnapped. They pack their service pistols and prepare to go to take on an entire drug cartel. But guess what? The police chief\'s friends are in the CIA and they decide, out of the goodness of their heart, to help two hotshot loose cannon detectives! So now, with the help of a bunch of CIA commandos half of Cuba is blown up and everyone goes home safe. Preposterous on all counts.\n\nThere are entertaining movies that follow this kind of preposterous formula. James Bond, for one. He is just as ridiculous as this movie, but he has a light side. He doesn\'t take himself too seriously. Those films have a tongue in cheek nature that constantly reminds us that we are watching what is basically a fairy tale. Not here. This film takes it self so seriously and tries to be ultra cool and slick. Thankfully it fails on all fronts of film making. Let\'s hope we don\'t see anything like it anytime soon.\n\nSick, disgusting, unoriginal, a horrible waste of money, superficial, unentertaining, unfunny, vulgar, and just plain terrible.

I mean, what is it about HIM that struck a coard with so many? People don\'t bash Simon West,Martin Campbell, Tony Scott, or Dominic Sena the way the bring the hammer down on Bay. It\'s not like he was the first guy who was really good at style over substance. I for one am gonna defend the guy here. And no, i\'m not some idiot teenager who thinks Charlie\'s Angels is the best movie ever made. I am an avid film watcher. I probably see close to 100 movies a year IN theaters. Big movies and small alike. I appreciate any genre of film if it\'s done well. But obviously my first love is, and always will be, action. And I think Michael Bay is one of the best action directors around. As good as James Cameron, John Woo, Ridley Scott, John McTerninan, John Frankenhiemer, and any other guy named John.\n\nIs Bad Boys II too exrtavigant? Too explosive? Too indulgent? It\'s not your money, why should you care? BB2 is action filmaking in it\'s purest, most volitile form. I can\'t remember seeing an action movie with this much, well, ACTION in it. This thing drills you like a jackhammer in a way that The Rock could only dream of. It comes close to the \"Enough Already\" level of action as in Armageddon, but holds off with all the humor brought by the stars. Was there one too many car chases? Yeah, probably, but I\'m not complaining. Two and a half hours looks just fine too me. Personally, I like my action movies to exhaust me.\n\nAnd what action it was. The car transport chase is easily better than anything in the Matrix Reloaded and even T3. Not only that, but it\'s great to see full blown R rated action in all its bloody glory again. Ahh, just like the good old days, when men were men, and action movies were all rated R.\n\nLook, if you\'re all about hating Bay, and blaming him for all of scociety\'s ills, as well as acusing him of being the antichrist - then what in god\'s name are you doing watching this movie? It\'s been pretty well established since The Rock, and especially Armageddon, that you don\'t like the guy - so why do you keep going to see these movies if you know you\'re going to hate them?

Oh, don\'t ask that. We can cut that shiit and get back to entertainment. Yes, BB 2 has some crazy car action sequences and witless banter between Marcus and Mike, but it isn\'t funny enough compared to the first film. Mike and Marcus are off to bust a drug racket, but the opponent leader has quite a strong record against the cops. He has fooled them many times before, so all they need is strong evidence against him. While Mike and Marcus are planning to bust into his house and get the evidence, Marcus\' cop sister is doing her part as an undercover agent turned the leader\'s girlfriend. As expected, M & M get what they want, but the sister, who also happens to be Mike\'s girlfriend, is in the bad guy\'s custody. Meanwhile, Marcus had made plans to part ways with his partner, Mike, who still believes in \"We ride together. We die together. Bad boys for life.\" The entire department turns into their aides, and we have a long and big action sequence in the climax. As mentioned earlier, the comedy is weak, mostly because the banter between two buddies lacks humour and wit. Bad Boys 1 ended with Julie and Mike getting handcuffed together, so I wonder what happened to Julie. There was no mention of her in this film. It just started off like a fresh film altogether. The scripting is fine, but the film is 15 minutes longer. That doesn\'t mean it\'s boring. It\'s a tight shiit alright. Lawrence and Smith save the day, and thankfully they get the maximum screen space. Jordi Mollà, as the new baddie, is decent, while Gabrielle Union, as a female cop, was okayish.

If it was just a bad movie, my comments would have ended in the last paragraph. This is a very very nasty film. Bodies explode, people are shredded by gunfire, limbs sawn off, and heads are sliced off and our two heroes wise-crack their way through all the devastation. Not just wise-crack, but laugh about it. Oh, but it\'s good fun to wave a gun in a humorous way in the face of a teenage boy whose only crime is to fancy your daughter. And let\'s have a bit of fun with some dead bodies shall we? The scene that really did it for me though, is when Lawrence is hiding in the mortuary under a sheet with a naked dead girl. I sat in the cinema feeling very uncomfortable. True, this is a \"comedy thriller\", but why such cheapness with human life and sickening use of women? Strangely enough, the film gets serious when Lawrence\'s sister or daughter(I can\'t remember which) is kidnapped. The wise-cracking stops and the audience is invited to share Lawrence\'s pain. I didn\'t. I wanted her to die so that Lawrence\'s character learned the value of human life. But, she is rescued and the moment she is safe, it\'s back to comedic carnage.

Wayne would never have done in the part of the maverick major in charge of training the way Lee Marvin was so perfect in the role. In fact Marvin\'s and the performance of others in the cast helped The Dirty Dozen get over two very big improbable situations I have always found in this film.\n\nThe first one being the way the conflict between Robert Ryan and Lee Marvin is handled. I can certainly see why a spit and polish West Point graduate like Ryan would not like Marvin, why Marvin would rub him the wrong way. But I cannot understand why when the Dozen are transferred to his command for parachute training they don\'t tell him what\'s going on. I would think he would have a need to know. Then again a whole big part of the film wouldn\'t have occurred if Ryan had been let in on Marvin\'s mission.\n\nThe second thing is that granted these guys might be considered expendable to say the least with several of the dozen scheduled for a firing squad, but the army would want to make sure the mission had some chance of succeeding. There\'s no way, absolutely no bloody way, that a psychotic like Telly Savalas would have been allowed on the mission. And why Lee Marvin didn\'t scrub him when psychiatrist Ralph Meeker offered to is beyond me as well.\n\nThose glaring holes in the story have always prevented me from giving The Dirty Dozen the top rating that most have given it. But it hasn\'t prevented me from enjoying the film.\n\nThe basic idea of the film appeals to me. An unorthodox major taking a group of nonconformists to say the least and making them a crack fighting outfit. Regular army training did not do it for this crew the first time around.\n\nCharles Bronson is one of the dozen and this film certainly put him well on the way to top billing. A dozen years later in fact he\'d have it over Lee Marvin in Death Hunt. Jim Brown also having just finished his football career began his movie career with a winning performance as another of the dozen. John Cassavetes was singled out for a Best Supporting Actor nomination. Also Donald Sutherland got his first real notice as yet another of the dozen.\n\nA year later William Holden and Cliff Robertson did The Devil\'s Brigade which bore a lot of resemblance to The Dirty Dozen. It got slammed by critics for ripping off from The Dirty Dozen. The only problem was that Holden\'s film was based on a real outfit and The Dirty Dozen is pure fiction. Only in movieland.\n\nMarvin\'s mission is to infiltrate and kill a lot of the German high command as they gather at a French château in the weeks before D-Day.

Adapted from an intelligent but Freudian source novel, the plot theme is a subtle one for a movie; it\'s about convicted men in WWII being given odds for life in the form of a suicide mission that may wipe their slates clean-- or perhaps not... its main theme is self-assertion, set against its opposite, enforced repression. The key to every action men undertake in this very tough and and tough-minded Nunnnally Johnason and Lukas Heller script is: \"Is that person dealing with the reality of the world of and his/her own responsibility to act?\" From convict Telly Savalas\' character, mystical murderer of women who claims a divine calling to punish their sexuality, to Charles Bronson and Jim Brown who reacted to persecutions and are innocent by reason of self-defense, to their leader, the mission\'s architect, Major Reisman, who wants his plan to go forward his way despite resistance from brass, every man of the outfit is tried against the same standard. Jimenez is climbing a rope and says he can\'t make the tower; Franco refuses to shave because the officers have hot water and he does not, Posey can\'t control his temper, control-freak Col. Breed hates any man who does not go by the book; etc. As a production, Robert Aldrich\'s direction is probably his masterpiece; the acting is far above average, especially Lee Marvin, Charles Bronson, Donald Sutherland, Clint Walker, Robert Webber, energetic John Cassevetes and Al Mancini; the inspired casting of powerful top-sergeant-level Ernest Borgnine as an obviously far-beyond-his element general works brilliantly. The art direction, special effects, sets, and music (by Frank de Vol) all complement a taut script filled with memorable terse dialogue. Entire sequences such as the selection interviews for the mission team, the building of the camp, a visit to Breed\'s hq, Breed\'s invasion of the camp, the training regimen, the \"graduation party\", Reisman\'s verbal defense of his men, the war games\' challenge, preparing for the mission, the early invasion steps, Maggot\'s adlib, the attack by Reisman\'s team, the escape and the hospital climax and denouement--all these sections are made memorable to many admirers of this beautifully made and unusual story. As officers attached to the mission, George Kennedy, Richard Jaene-too-subtle secondary theme of the film is: the wrongness of arbitrary power in anyone\'s hands, including Nazis, US army officers or their brutal agents (such as Breed\'s men who beat up Charles Bronson for information). The film is about individuals who when they harm no one else and are effective human beings, men who can always get the job done, always control themselves. who need to be free to operate. Such men the film says are \"heroes\"--men with an unusual ability to create results on Earth; the sort of men films ought to be made about in a nation that talks individualism and claims to value capability. This is a great adventure, of enduring artistry, occasional brutality and intelligently-developed dialogue. It has logical actions, and spectacular physical performances and This is a strong and well-thought-out adventure film, one of the richest of its genre, to be watched many times.'),(809,47,'Infofreak','Smell the testosterone! The Dirty Dozen is the quintessential \"guys on a mission\" movie!','8 June 2003','Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.','Quentin Tarantino looks like he just might follow through with his threat to make the ultimate \"guys on a mission movie\" if he gets his \'Inglorious Bastards\' on to the big screen, but he\'ll be pushed to equal \'The Dirty Dozen\', the quintessential movie in the genre. 35 years on and it\'s still one of the best WW2 adventure movies, and a strong contender for the ultimate guys movie. It shouldn\'t be taken too seriously - I don\'t think anyone is going to argue it\'s a realistic depiction of war - but it\'s still one of the most entertaining movies around, and it\'s impressive collection of tough guys and character actors is really hard to beat. Director Aldrich had previously made the classic noir \'Kiss Me Deadly\' (starring Ralph Meeker who reappears here in a supporting role) and the wonderfully creepy \'Whatever Happened To Baby Jane\', but this is arguably going to be THE movie he\'s remembered for. Screen legend Lee Marvin (\'Point Blank\', \'The Killers\') with the assistance of his Sgt (Richard Jaeckel), must train a motley collection of criminal and misfits (including John Cassavetes, Jim Brown, Telly Savalas, Charles Bronson, Clint Walker and Donald Sutherland), for a suicide mission behind enemy lines. Marvin is just great, extremely cool and charismatic, but also a fine actor, something which is often overlooked. The ensemble cast (which also includes George Kennedy, and two future stars of \'The Wild Bunch\', Ernest Borgnine and Robert Ryan) are uniformly excellent, but Cassavetes is particularly outstanding, Sutherland is memorable as a half wit, and Savalas is unforgettable as the religious psychopath Maggott. \'The Dirty Dozen\' is first class entertainment and highly recommended. It put 90% of today\'s \"action movies\" to shame!'),(810,47,'10/10','Excellent WWII Action Piece and Representation of 60s Pop Culture','SgtSlaughter','28 March 2005','Acclaimed director Robert Aldrich (also famous to war film buffs for his rule-breaking drama, \"Attack\") twists the familiar \'unit picture\' into a famous story of unexpected heroism in the midst of World War II. Instead of making his heroes clean-cut, American draftees, we\'re looking at the dirtiest convicts the Armed Forces has got to offer.\n\nOSS Major Reisman (Lee Marvin, \"Hell in the Pacific\") is an insubordinate Army officer who\'s facing a court-martial, when he\'s given one last chance for a reprieve: select twelve Army prisoners from a maximum-security detention center, train them for a top-secret mission behind the German lines, and then lead them into battle. If they succeed in the mission, they\'ll be released. For Reisman, it\'s a tough call, but it\'s his only chance to save his career.\n\nThe men he was to work with are a mixed batch, and director Aldrich packs a lot of character development into a two-and-a-half-hour movie. The most important of the \"Dirty Dozen\" is Franko, a small-time Chicago hoodlum who\'s facing the gallows for robbery and subsequent murder of a British civilian. It\'s clear from the start that Franko is a loner who thinks he\'s big stuff, but Reisman manages to prove that he\'s really all talk. More than once, he considers and even attempts escape from the remote training camp that the Dozen are forced to build  but maybe, just maybe, beneath that rebellious attitude, there\'s a chance for redemption.\n\nThen there are some more sympathetic types: Wladislaw (Charles Bronson, \"Battle of the Bulge\") was once a front-line infantryman who shot his platoon\'s medic when the medic got scared under fire and started running  Bronson says \"He took off with all the medical supplies only way to stop him was to shoot him.\" Jefferson (Jim Brown, \"Ice Station Zebra\") has been convicted for murder  his defense is he was defending himself from vicious, racist MPs who were abusing him. Wladislaw and Jefferson find themselves allied in order to get Franko on their side, because they have faith in Reisman and aren\'t willing to let Franko\'s rebellion become infectious.\n\nAlso in fine support is Clint Walker (\"None But the Brave\") as the big Navajo, Posey, who punched a man too hard for shoving him. He really didn\'t mean to kill him; he just doesn\'t like being pushed. Posey comes off as a cuddly teddy bear who\'d never intentionally hurt a soul, and it\'s clear from the start that he\'s one of the good guys. Finally, Telly Savalas (\"Kelly\'s Heroes\") lends a hand as the psychotic, racist, religious fanatic Maggot, who believes his job is to punish the other 11 men for their \"wickedness\". His motives are never really clear; all we really know is that Maggot is somewhat unhinged and potentially dangerous.\n\nEven though Reisman and his squad don\'t get along, they\'re forced to become allied against a common enemy  the American General Staff, who want to do nothing short of shut the operation down. Aldrich again breaks the rules, making the conventionally \"good guys\" into the enemy. The Germans are barely mentioned throughout the first two acts, and only become involved for the explosive finale. The heart of this movie is anti-establishment behavior, right in the vein of the protest culture of the 60s: the good guys are the unshaven criminals, and the bad guys are the clean-cut, well-dressed Generals who come across as stupid and vain. As Colonel Everett Dasher Breed, Robert Ryan (\"Flying Leathernecks\") makes an excellent bully, a villain that the Dozen eventually unite to take action against.\n\nOnce the men have been trained and are finally cooperating and acting as a unit, it\'s time to set them loose on the Nazis. And still, the story doesn\'t become stereotypical. The mission is simple: the men will parachute into occupied France, penetrate a château being used as a rest center for high-level German officers, and kill as many of said officers as possible in a short amount of time. This operation involves stabbing defenseless women, machine-gunning prisoners, and finally, locking several dozen German officers and their mistresses in an underground bomb shelter, pouring gasoline down on them through air vents, loading said air vents with hand grenades, and then blowing up the whole place.\n\nCharacters and story aside, the film benefits from some superb editing by Michael Luciano. Director Aldrich and cinematographer Edward Scaife work hand in hand to compose every shot. The cramped, dank prison cells in the first act are utterly convincing, and the layout of the huge, magnificent German-occupied château looks, quite appropriately, like a cross between a marvelous mansion and an impregnable fortress. The battle scenes are well-choreographed, too. Never does a moment go by where we do not know where one encounter is happening in relation to what the rest of the squad is dealing with in and around the Château. Frank de Vol\'s sweeping score is used sparingly, and adds to both the humor and suspense of the picture. One scene, in which Donald Sutherland\'s character \"inspects\" a platoon of the 82nd Airborne, is set to a live orchestra\'s performance perfectly.\n\nWar is a really a dirty business  this isn\'t a movie about men playing by the rules. It\'s about breaking every rule in the book to get a job done, and if a few innocent bystanders get in the way, they\'re simply collateral damage. On a higher level, Aldrich\'s film reflects culture attitudes of the late 60s. Moviegoers wanted a film which encouraged breaking the rules, which showed the higher levels of the American military as deeply flawed, and made the dregs of society into the heroes of the piece. It\'s a cynical representation of the time it was made in, but holds up flawlessly 40 years later, in a culture which has probably been shaped by the attitudes the film reflects in every frame.\n\n10/10'),(811,47,'10/10','One of the most quintessential macho movies of all time.','hitchcockthelegend','11 December 2010','The Dirty Dozen is directed by Robert Aldrich and adapted for the screen by Nunnally Johnson & Lukas Heller from the novel by E.

This particular château has no military value as such, but as it is used by many of the Nazi big chiefs, destroying it whilst they relax inside will upset the German plans immensely. But can this rag tag band of murderers, rapists and thieves shape up into something resembling a fighting force? Their reward, should they survive the mission, is amnesty, but Reisman for sure has his hands full on both sides of the war.\n\n\"One: down to the road block, we\'ve just begun..

Which while it most definitely deserves such big exposure, it\'s a little surprising it\'s part of the holiday viewing schedules given its cynicism and amoral core, something which is one of the many great & intriguing things about Aldrich\'s testosterone laced movie. Met with mixed reviews on release, with the negative side of the fence bemoaning its nasty violence and preposterous plot, The Dirty Dozen none the less performed great at the box office where it was the fifth highest grosser of the year and the number one money maker in terms of profit to budget. Coming as it did during the middle of the Vietnam War, it was evident that the paying public quite easily bought into the thematics of it all. Over 50 years since it first lured people into the picture houses, Aldrich\'s movie shows no sign of aged frayed edges, or better still, and more remarkable, the enjoyability factors it holds has not diminished.\n\nWhat makes it a great film, then? First off is the all-star macho cast assembled by Aldrich and his team, big hitters like Marvin (stepping in when John Wayne balked at the script), Borgnine, Kennedy, Ryan and Bronson were already names to the public, but these are also supplemented by soon to be \"stars\" like Cassavetes, Sutherland and Savalas (also stepping into a role vacated by another, this time Jack Palance who didn\'t like the racial aggression of the character) & stoic performers like Jaeckel & Robert Webber. Into the mix is curio value with the casting of singer Trini Lopez and Gridiron star Jim Brown. Throw Clint Walker into the pot as well and you have got a considerable amount of beef in the stew! Secondly the film led the way for a slew of movies that featured bad guys as heroes, so with that Aldrich\'s film holds up well as being a hugely influential piece. Then thirdly is that not only is it intermittently funny as the violence explodes on the screen, but that it\'s also chocked full of action and adventure. All that and for those so inclined you can find questionable morals under scrutiny and see the \"war is hell\" banner firmly flown during the nastiness of the missions\' culmination.\n\nSplit into three parts - meet the guys - see them train - and then the mission, pic has been criticised for its lack of realism, but is that really needed in what is essentially a male fantasy piece setting out to entertain? Besides which, lets applaud it for acknowledging that brutality and atrocities were committed on both sides of the fence, rest assured, The Dirty Dozen still had enough edginess about it back in the 60s! It\'s also true enough to say that the characters, are in the main, stereotypes, and that the unravelling story is a touch clichéd, but these are men that men want to be (okay maybe not Savalas\' religious maniac rapist!) and men that women can cast a flirtatious eye over - there\'s plenty of character here to hang your hats and undergarments on as they appeal to the inner rebel hidden away in many a viewer. The messages in here are not sledge hammered into the story (Aldrich always said he wasn\'t making a message movie, just a film about camaraderie and unlikely heroes), and the construction of the action is top notch from one of America\'s most under appreciated directors. It\'s nicely shot in 70mm MetroColor/MetroScope by Edward Scaife (Night of the Demon/Khartoum) and features a suitably boisterous music score from Frank De Vol (Cat Ballou/The Flight of the Phoenix).\n\nIt\'s a far from flawless picture, of that there is no doubt, but it\'s loved by millions and continues to gain an audience yearly by those who are willing to view it on its own entertaining terms. As a boy I wanted to be Lee Marvin because of this film, as a middle aged man now, I still want to be Lee Marvin in this film. That\'s yet another reason why The Dirty Dozen is so great. 10/10'),(812,47,'7/10','A well structured and interesting story, although poorly edited in the final act','PyrolyticCarbon','20 February 2005','It\'s difficult when you approach an old movie to see it for the first time and you have to try and drop all the baggage associated with it from reviews and analysis over the years. The Dirty Dozen is such a movie. I just watched it for the first time last night on TV, clipped though it was for those smaller brained people among us who don\'t like to see dark bits at the top and bottom of their screens.\n\nIt\'s interesting that there are three real character acts to this movie. There\'s the dark opening and character introduction, the fun act where the characters meld together into a team, and the closing act where the mission, and the war, become a stark and deadly reality. That last act is dark too, although there a couple of accidental laughs in there for the worst character expression at a death ever, and one particularly bad death scene.\n\nWhat does strike you about the opening is how really dark it all is. We\'re talking about murders who are looking at to be retrained. Indeed one is a rapist with a serious God complex who is bordering on utterly insane. They are about to be hanged for their crimes, but have one last chance. Poor Major John Reisman has no say in the matter, he has his band and has to make them work.\n\nIt\'s well filmed for the first two character acts, and the acting is very good. John Cassavetes and Telly Savalas are wonderful in their roles. In fact it\'s a surprise to see Savalas in such a role and shining so brightly. Donald Sutherland also shows he has some excellent character acting in him. The rest are far from bad, but you can see a lot of typecasting for them.\n\nThe movement from the dark opening to the more jovial training act is interesting to watch, as this is exactly how many of the characters are seeing it, as a bit of fun. What they aren\'t expecting is the third character act, that of the actual war itself, and for some this proves too much.\n\nThe difficulty I had with the final act is only in the filming. There are premature cuts, awkward angles and jumping storytelling. So much is missed by the camera, and it doesn\'t feel like it\'s there to let your imagination run, it seems like someone has cut the film deliberately, and quite badly. There are quite a few scene transitions that just don\'t work at all.\n\nHowever, where it doesn\'t fail is bringing the characters to their ultimate journey, that of redemption and a renewed desire to fight for their Major, and their fellow men. They become soldiers, and indeed heroes.\n\nIt\'s a good war film to watch, very well structured and reflective of the characters journeys. It\'s just that final act for me which spoiled my enjoyment, and purely in the filming of it.'),(813,47,'10/10','The Best Ensemble Rugged He-Man Cast Ever !!!!!!','louiss','7 January 1999','Time and Turner saturating the airways about once a month have taken some toll on the impact of this great action adventure film which has the best ensemble rugged he-man cast every to take on the Nazi\'s on film.

Bronson, Brown & Walker are the brawn of the group and the film provides all of them the opportunity to display their physical attributes. Sutherland represents the only other major character of the dozen as the unit idiot. Lee Marvin was in his prime and I consider this his best and most definitive role as the leader of the dozen. Borgnine and Ryan also standout as adversarial superiors to Marvin. This was a man\'s film from beginning to end and although not as colorful or explicit as the excellent book it was based on it was every bit as good a film as was the book and the exciting climax was a big improvement on the non climactic book.'),(814,47,'7/10','Box-office hit about a misfit team led by Lee Marvin who carry out a suicide mission behind enemy lines','ma-cortes','18 June 2011','A group of conscripted convicts formed by twelve condemned , already destined for death row, are drafted to go on a near-suicide mission and attempt to eliminate a Nazi staff . ¨Dirty Dozen¨ is an entertaining film with Lee Marvin as tough officer along with the ordinary team of renegade soldiers of World War II . Marvin training a group of rebel and misfit soldiers for a dangerous assault on a palace-château. In the hands of hardboiled director Robert Aldrich and a tough-as-leather cast headed by Lee Marvin , as a troublesome U.S. Army Major , that\'s all the plot that\'s needed to make one rip-roaring wartime flick. Marvin\'s mission is two-fold and in violent and cynical style : first turn his prisoners into a fighting unit and then turn them loose on a German fortress located in Britain . His crime-minded characters include John Cassavetes as rebel inmate , Clint Walker as a chronic malcontent, Telly Savalas as a ready-to-blow psycho, Donald Sutherland as a lame-brained convict and many others . The first half of the film allows the colorful cast of character actors to have their fun as they get their tails whipped into shape and develop shaky relationship with their leader. The final part is all action, as the culprit commandos wreck havoc and then run for their lives. Despite the fact that few of the \"heroes\" survive the bloodbath, the message here isn\'t that war is hell. Rather, it seems to be: war can be a hell of a good time... if you\'ve got nothing to lose . The relentless assignment is set against strong training, risked adventures and hazardous feats .

Then they are parachuted and arrive in French Bretain and attacking the palace . At the end they must participate in the suicidal mission behind the enemy lines , to wipe the German group by means of a violent assault over a strongly protected castle.\n\nLee Marvin as Major Reisman assumes the character of the leader of the Dirty Dozen in this wartime classic movie directed by Robert Aldrich and based on the characters created by T.M. Nathanson , being scripted by Nunnally Johnson and Lukas Heller. This moving film packs frantic thrills, perilous adventures , relentless feats , and buck-loads of explosive action and violence. The noisy action is uniformly well-made, especially deserving of mention the rip-roaring final scenes on the fortress , including some spectacular shootouts and bombing . Apart from the values of team spirit , cudgeled by Lee Marvin into his rebel group , the film is full of feats , suspense , and thrills .

Its very dangerous trying to humourise war in the movies, because that would be offensive to all those that had served & died in real life. Kelly\'s Heroes and 1941 probably went a little too far, pretending that war is really fun & cool when you\'ve got people like Clint Eastwood in charge. But then you have other war films that are black in its humour but manage to keep into focus the cruelty & horrors of war at the same time - M*A*S*H and Catch 22 are the best examples. With Dirty Dozen we have something of a go-between; the humour amongst the characters is light & welcoming but never falls into farce or bad-taste; and Aldrich quickly pulls us back into the fold with some tight scripted scenes of drama & mass murder (throwing petrol & grenades into that German bunker to name but one. I often wonder about that scene, and whether it was some kind of metaphor for the gas chambers & concentration camps in Belsen) But unlike MASH & Catch 22, Aldrich resists the temptation to openly politicise the effects of war, after all this film was made in \'67 near the height of the Vietnam war/protests. Instead he takes a straight line course of action and lets us be moved & entertained by the convicted GIs doing their duty. Marvin is excellent as the hardnosed but disobediant Major. He plays the anti-hero far better than Eastwood in Kelly\'s Heroes. Marvin just looks the type who\'d give the top brass as well the Germans a real hard time. But special mention must go to Cassavettes as Viktor Franko, the trouble-maker\'s trouble-maker. His character is so refreshing & wild amongst a relatively mild cast of supporting extras, with the exception of Savalas. Franko is the Joker of the pack but you soon feel an attachment for him in spite of his crimes. Sutherland & Bronson, don\'t really add much. The former plays a slightly naive man who hasn\'t really grown up and Bronson just smirks & mumbles a lot. The only other character worthy of a mention is the truly terrifying Savalas, who is a Christian through & through, yet hates all women as much as the Germans; and has a most spine chilling laugh! Difficult to believe this man later became Kojak! The film is a tad overlong; the first & last 40 minutes hold the interest but the middle section (the War Games scene), is far too long and generally detracts.

Lee Marvin plays Major Reisman, assigned to coordinate a suicide mission on a French chateau held by top Nazi officers. Since no \"normal\" GI can be expected to volunteer for this mission, Reisman is compelled to draw his personnel from a group of military prisoners serving life sentences. This \"dirty dozen\" includes a sex pervert (Telly Savalas), a psycho (John Cassavetes), a killer (Donald Sutherland), and the equally malevolent Charles Bronson, Trini Lopez, Jim Brown, and Clint Walker. On the dim promise of receiving pardons if they survive, the criminals undergo a brutal training program, then are marched behind enemy lines dressed as Nazi soldiers, the better to overtake the chateau and kill everyone in it--including the innocent wives and mistresses of the German officers.\n\nThe cast here is brilliant and each brings something to the screen that makes this such a great film.

Well, I guess I should say that I consider it a prelude to Police Academy. I saw many parallels with Major Reisman (Lee Marvin) trying to train his band of misfits similar to Police Academy. But The Dirty Dozen isn\'t simply a crude gag-a-minute comedy. It is a nice blend of a bit of comedy, some drama, and some wartime action.\n\nThe story is very smartly put together. Taking place during World War II Major Reisman is told to train a group of twelve military prisoners to go on very much a suicide mission. I know, I know... Suicide Squad right? Well, this was 50 years before that and with far more endearing characters. The prisoners have the choice (which is not much of a choice) to go on this mission and be pardoned or refuse and accept their sentence. Being that all of them are facing sentences from as little as 20 years up to hanging, the choice became easy.\n\nThe characters were fantastic: Donald Sutherland as the Christopher Lloyd-like goofy Vernon Pinkley, Jim Brown as the few-worded Robert Jefferson, Telly Savalas as the fire and brimstone Southern religious nut, and John Cassavetes as the loud, unruly, and obnoxious Victor Franco were the real standouts. I loved the mixture of characters and Major Reisman\'s relationship to them all. They were all condemned and in a way he was condemned with them. That didn\'t mean they had to live condemned and that didn\'t mean they didn\'t have anything to contribute. But as I said, this movie was made awesome by the performances.

The thing about The Dirty Dozen is it is very different to most other war films and with the added comedy you\'ve got something very unique. Most importantly The Dirty Dozen proves that to be a good solider you have to break a few rules.\n\nFrom the cold opening monologue to the explosive finale you\'ve got yourself a film that sets a standard for how to make an action movie years and years since. The Dirty Dozen is famous for its wonderful ensemble cast that provides humour as well as study. All of the 12 men trained by Lee Marvin the cold head of command are ex-convicts and all of them are some of the most twisted people known to man. The film studies the violence on and behind the war zone. The Dirty Dozen entertains as well as an insight; this is great in my opinion. Some people say The Dirty Dozen can\'t be taken seriously, I sure think it can. Even though the film is a comedy it still is a serious film in many places. The film has managed to place itself in 60s pop culture for being so iconic. The film\'s acting from the entire cast remains on top throughout the entire film. If you think about The Dirty Dozen is a disturbing film, the segment with the gasoline and grenades being poured down the shafts is done in such a odd fashion that you\'ll find it hard to grasp it.\n\nThe film\'s style is one that remains as cool as it was back in 1967. The editing is very cleanly cut and The Dirty Dozen\'s pace runs with a rhythm still keeping its substance. Many of the camera shots and the final, body count filled massacre has a certain feel of excellence to it. You can really feel the time spent on creating set pieces, acting ability, direction etc. The Dirty Dozen\'s atmosphere from all this is a menacing dark one, the fact it\'s menacing is because of the added humour and the dark because of the whole crazy idea. The film does run smoothly and feels very tight because there are no subplots and the fact that everything is so precise. The Dirty Dozen is a movie that has been spawned with carbon copy films and TV sequels.\n\nThe script is one of great originality because it mixes sardonic humour with great speeches and one-liners. You\'ll be sure to have a favourite character by the end of the film. Many of the cast and characters have gone down in history providing a great step up for the cast\'s careers. Charles Bronson. And Donald Sutherland are probably some of the most recognisable to the viewer today. The Dirty Dozen remains a sharp, raw and stark film through its two and a half hour running time. So you can either watch The Dirty Dozen in two ways, one to study the army through a wide open image or secondly as a highly entertaining action movie. The most important question The Dirty Dozen make the viewer ask is none other than \"Is this what the army is really like?\" I\'d say it is and by making a film that shows that the best war men are criminals Robert Aldrich has created an anti war statement.'),(820,47,'7/10','Like a 1960\'s DC Comics World War II adventure','johno-21','10 April 2006','I saw first saw this during it\'s initial theatrical release and have seen it many times since. A group of prisoners are led by a renegade Major with disciplinary problems of his own to penetrate enemy lines in preparation for D-Day and disrupt the German chain of command by killing a gathering of top Nazi brass at a château. If the prisoners succeed and survive they will have their sentences commuted. If the Major pulls it off he\'ll save his career. This is adapted from the 1965 best selling novel by E.M. Nathanson and based on a story told to Nathanson by sexplotation film director Russ Meyer. Meyer was a cameraman in the signal corps during World War II mostly assigned to General Patton. In the real dirty dozen story, they were parachute dropped into occupied France on an assassination mission. They never completed their assignment however. Being typical undependable criminals once they hit the ground they hightailed it for Spain for the rest of the war. The real dirty dozen scenario is much more plausible than this far-fetched tale made into a film by director Robert Aldrich. Proliffic writer/director/producer Nunnally Johnson wrote the screenplay. Aldrich had made some good films in the 50\'s including Kiss Me Deadly and had a string of good films in the 60\'s leading up The Dirty Dozen including Whatever Happened to Baby Jane, Hush Hush, Sweet Charlotte and Flight of the Pheonix. He dealt with prisoners again in the Longest Yard and would revisit the violence of the Dozen with Ulzani\'s Raid. A great cast here with film veterans Lee Marvin, Ernest Borgnine, Robert Ryan, Ralph Meeker and Charles Bronson and actors who would become well known including Donald Sutherland, Telly Savalas, George Kennedy, John Cassavetes in his only Academy Award nominated performance (he lost out to Kennedy who won for his performance in Cool Hand Luke)and Jim Brown, who retired from the NFL while filming this for an acting career. Also in the cast are Richard Jaekel, Robert Webber and Trini Lopez. Nominated for four Academy Awards the MGM Sound Department took home it\'s only win for Best Sound Effects. It\'s a good action film with a great cast but it\'s too much like a comic book action story than an actual war drama story. The entire plot is so implausible and unnecessary that if there is a message in this film about war, double standards, senselessness, hypocrisy etc.. it gets lost in the mayhem. If you remember World War II themed comic books from the 60\'s like Sgt. Rock, Our Fighting Forces or GI Combat, this movie more resembles them than a typical war picture. There are some good lines and dialog and this is well made film but not my favorite war picture. I would give it a 7.5 out of 10.'),(821,47,'10/10','The Twelve Convicted Heroes','claudio_carvalho','20 July 2016','During the World War II, Major Reisman (Lee Marvin) is a tough and efficient military with problems with his superiors. He is assigned by General Worden (Ernest Borgnine) for an almost impossible top secret suicide mission: to kill as much senior German officers as possible in a retreat on the eve of the D-Day. He must train twelve undisciplined convicted soldiers, most of them sentenced to death, to accomplish the mission. He joins the twelve men under the positive leadership of Joseph Wladislaw (Charles Bronson) and the negative leadership of the insubordinate Victor Franko (John Cassavetes) and tries to form a team with the support of Sergeant Bowren (Richard Jaeckel). He makes General Worden to promise to release them all if they are well succeeded. Meanwhile his enemy Colonel Everett Dasher Breed (Robert Ryan) tries to make his life more difficult but Reisman and his twelve men need to prove that they are efficient. Will they succeed in their mission?\n\n\"The Dirty Dozen\" is one of the best movies about war, with the perfect combination of action and comedy. Despite the 2h 30 min running time, this film is never boring; indeed it is highly entertaining. Director Robert Aldrich makes another masterpiece and the performances of the magnificent cast are top-notch. The conclusion is quite moralist and predictable with most of the soldiers dying but it is part of the American culture in the 60\'s, since it would be unjustified killers convicted to death by hanging be proclaimed national heroes and stay alive.

Working from a script by veteran screenwriters Nunnally Johnson and Lukas Heller, (based on a novel by E.M Nathanson), Aldrich wastes no time on extraneous detail or historical context; he\'s clearly interested in keeping this 2-and-a-half hour epic moving along, as it contains a lot of characters, tough dialogue, and well-staged action.\n\nAt the same time, little effort is expended in disguising the story\'s schizoid nature. Its first half is a fairly standard, though rousing, WWII adventure with a skilled cast expertly portraying the typical band of misfits -- in this case, American military prisoners -- who bond under fierce training and are molded into an efficient fighting force.\n\nThen in the second half, the results of this training are unblinkingly depicted with the assault on an R&R stronghold for the German high command in which the mission is simply to kill as many of the enemy as possible. That this happens to include a large number of civilian noncombatants, many of them women, seems of scant concern. The slaughter is mainly accomplished with gasoline dumped down ventilator shafts on those trapped in the cellars below, then ignited.\n\nIt makes for exciting spectacle, but might also leave something of a bad taste in your mouth.'),(825,47,'1/10','Glorifying war crimes','evan-19','7 August 2002','\"The Dirty Dozen\" is really two movies: the first half is a hilarious, well-acted, thoroughly entertaining romp. That\'s probably what makes the second half so horrendous. The last half-hour deals with how the \"heroes\" we\'ve come to like basically burn a bunch of helpless women to death. If this was a German film, circa the forties, we would see it as absolute confirmation of the fundamental evils of Naziism.

Revenge is sweet.','siderite','25 October 2005','I was ready to bet that this was a remake after an older movie. Great 60\'s and 70\'s music, the endless theme of the small town terrorized by a villain and the rise to justice of the people involved, Mark Wahlberg... ;)\n\nOK, I am unfair to the man, but it\'s true isn\'t it? He is always cast into old looking movies or remakes. I actually like how he is playing. I think that he is a reasonable actor and has potential beyond the action movies in which we\'ve become accustomed to seeing him.\n\nThe plot is quite simple: adoptive mother of four and town saint gets killed by thugs. The four brothers kick ass accordingly. But beyond the obvious cliché, the movie was quite good. The actors played well, the feelings were nicely transmitted to the audience and the details were realistic enough and emotion conveying. Actually, for this kind of movie, I am ready to grade high.\n\nThe bad thing about this film were the villains. Unconvincing small time crooks that suddenly have the power to hire people with Steyr Augur rifles and other high power weapons. Unconvincing crooked cop who has no motive for actually being corrupt. In the end, the movie is rather relaxing, considering we never meet anything unexpected.\n\nWorth a watch, although I would rate it as a TV movie, to watch in bed, rather than a cinema thing.'),(827,49,'8/10','How refreshing - a movie that actually exceeded my expectations!','TheMovieMark','12 August 2005','If you had ever told me that I would end up really liking a movie starring Marky Mark from the Funky Bunch and the lead singer of Outkast (the perpetrators of one of the most annoying songs in recent history - Hey Ya) then I would\'ve laughed right in your face. Come on, a movie with three rappers (Tyrese throws down the rhymes also, yo!)? There\'s no way I would\'ve expected that to satisfy my entertainment needs. But I\'m man enough to admit that I would\'ve been wrong.\n\nFour Brothers is a gritty, testosterone-fueled crowd pleaser that mixes drama, action, and humor. If you\'re looking for something light and fluffy then keep on looking because you won\'t find it here. But if you\'re in the mood to see some bad guys get pumped full of bullets and fists then this will put a smile on your face. The audience at the screening I attended was clapping and cheering throughout the movie. You\'d have thought we were at a wrestling match.\n\nThis plays out a bit like a Western. A wrong is done, a posse seeks to get revenge against the wrongdoers, and the wrongdoers are painted in such an unlikable fashion that you\'re just begging for them to taste a little vigilante justice.\n\nAs for the good guys, well, they fall under the \"anti-hero\" moniker. They aren\'t scared to sidestep the law in order to get what they\'re after. But within the context of the movie you can\'t really blame their motives. Their mother adopted them when nobody else wanted anything to do with them. They were considered lost causes, yet she took them in, gave them a family, and put her faith in them.\n\nThey didn\'t turn out to be saints, but as one cop says, \"They\'re Congressmen compared to what they would\'ve been.\" Now their mother, just an old lady always trying to do good, is dead and the cops don\'t seem to be doing anything about it. Wrongs have to be made right, and the brothers decide they\'re the ones that have to make it right.\n\nThis is one of those movies that I figured I\'d somewhat enjoy, but I walked out of the theater thinking, \"Man, I didn\'t expect it to be THAT good!\" It\'s rare that I find such a diamond in the rough, so I savor it as if I\'m Rob Schneider at a stupid movie convention.\n\nOne reason I had my doubts going in was I feared it might be drowned in loud, annoying hip-hop stylings. Plus, every Outkast song I\'ve ever heard has made me want to gouge my eardrums with a letter opener, so I feared the worst from Andre Benjamin. \"How annoying is this guy going to be?\" I asked myself. But all my fears were unfounded. Instead, we\'re surrounded by a world of crooked cops, bad guys who wear man-furs, surprisingly good acting, believable chemistry, a couple of subtle twists, and a really cool car chase on ice. I\'m always up for a good revenge flick, and I\'m happy to report that this one exceeded my expectations.\n\nTHE GIST\n\nAre you easily offended by violent revenge flicks?

The story moves along and does not step outside of itself. There are some intriguing plot twists, but the goal of revenge always remains. The performances are solid; we have experienced film actors and a director here who know what they\'re doing. Even the newer actors settle into their respective roles...\n\nJohn Singleton stated he wanted to do something with a \"western edge\" and in this film he has done just that. The story could be transplanted 100 years back and still work. While there is a great deal of action, violence, and bloodshed, it is not shot with an abundance of CGI or special effects...to that end, the action looks and feels more realistic.

A year later I had almost forgot about it until I started seeing commercials on TV and I got my hopes high. To be honest, this is probably the first movie that met my expectations.\n\nI didn\'t go in expecting the greatest movie ever, I mean it does have Marky Mark in it and I\'d hate to think he\'s be the start of my favorite movie of all time. But I did expect it to be exciting, emotional, and engaging... And it was.\n\nOne of the things this movie does best is show the love and commitment between the brothers. The chemistry between the actors was excellent and really added to the feel of the film. It takes a lot to get emotion out of me in a movie, I\'m talking the beginning of Saving Private Ryan a lot, so I unfortunately didn\'t feel as much as some of the other people in the theater, but you know something is right when people cheer when the main characters kill bad guys and yell \"NO!\" when things don\'t go right. The emotions between the brothers also led to many very funny comic moments, which I did not expect to see as many as I did. I laughed many times.\n\nSingleton is probably a better write than director, but he does a decent job through out. Most of the film is simple camera angles and what not, but there were a few moments, specifically a car chase, that was shot really well. It was all done in a manor that kept it realistic while keeping it interesting. It should also be noted that this movie had the SECOND most intense shoot out I\'ve ever seen in a movie. Second only to, of course, the LA streets shoot out in Heat which, in my opinion, is the most intense 15 minutes ever filmed.\n\nActing was decent. Like mentioned before, the chemistry between the brothers was great, but there were many simple one-liners and Mark Wahlberg seems to play the same character way too often.

I didn\'t have really high expectations and why should I, much less you? Well, if you do have high expectations, you better lower them, because \"Four Brothers\" is not a deep and involving picture but is really more of a straight-forward action flick with a few sly one-liners thrown in for good measure.\n\nThere\'s not a single wince of brain activity throughout it, though the four \"brothers\" of the title (Mark Wahlberg, Andre Benjamin, Tyrese Gibson, Garrett Hedlund), explained by one character as being \"total f**k-ups,\" do express a convincing degree of unity in that you actually believe they\'re related through their deceased, adopted mother Evelyn Mercer (Fionnula Flanagan).\n\nWahlberg is Bobby Mercer, the courageous tough-talking eldest brother and the one with a chip on his shoulder. Not surprisingly, he does the most talking and is the obvious leader. Benjamin is Jeremiah Mercer, the only one of the four to really make something of himself in that he has a legitimate business, a wife (Taraji P. Henson) and children, and the closest ties to their mother. Gibson is Angel Mercer, a (former) soldier of fortune who has the ladies (including feisty Latina Sofia Vergara), the bragging rights, and the connections. Lastly, Hedlund is Jack Mercer, the youngest and grungiest of the four who\'s also a wannabe rocker and had the most troublesome childhood of them all.\n\nThe four are reunited at the funeral of their dear mom, who was viciously slain in a liquor store robbery. The brothers suspect that because of the particularly heinous nature of the crime, their mother may not have been some innocent bystander but was really executed, and the robbery itself was just there to throw off the cops.\n\nAfter much contemplation and not even bothering to heed the warnings of two flaky detectives (played by Terrence Howard and Josh Charles), the four go after their mom\'s killer. It shouldn\'t be any surprise that they find their mother had been inadvertently drawn into the middle of some big insurance scheme or something along those lines (it\'s not really all that well explained), so the brothers look to settle the score with anyone - everyone.\n\nAs directed by John Singleton (whose outstanding landmark 1991 debut \"Boyz N the Hood\" remains the pinnacle of his career), \"Four Brothers\" is loud, dumb, and violent. The plot does a little more than resemble \"The Sons of Katie Elder\" (1965), which I haven\'t seen, but I doubt it was as lacking in intelligence as \"Four Brothers.\"\n\nHowever, the movie should be praised because it is strangely appealing (the totally PC leads notwithstanding), and the action is fast and furious, culminating in an impossible car chase through the ice-slicked Detroit streets during a snowstorm. And Singleton shows he hasn\'t completely lost my respect in that he\'s a good director during these scenes and succeeds in creating a believable atmosphere of unity amongst the four brothers.\n\nI expect this movie to be a success, since it\'s the last week of the summer and the August season of blockbusters has passed.

It\'s also not a brilliant piece of film making.\n\nThe characters were so stereotypical and predictable (cookie-cutter gangster, generic tough guys with hearts of gold, good cop, bad cop, crooked politician, kind old lady, fiery Latina, etc...), it was hard to develop much serious interest in any of them. I found a lot of scenes highly comical; the problem is, I wasn\'t sure I was supposed to be laughing. When the movie obviously tried for comic relief, I just sighed. It was during the highly \"dramatic\" or heart-felt scenes where I found myself laughing hysterically. The dinner table scene where each of the four brothers remembers \"Mom\" was so bad, it made me cringe and laugh out loud at the same time. I think this confusion persists throughout the movie. It\'s never clear how seriously we\'re supposed to take any of this.\n\nThe plot is full of gigantic holes and leaps in logic. However, movies do require a certain suspension of disbelief, so I\'ll let most of it slide. The characters are mere cartoons, so nothing feels real anyway. The most real thing here is the setting in Detroit. It looks gritty, cold, abandoned and dangerous. I\'m sure Detroit residents weren\'t thrilled by the city\'s portrayal in this movie (although it may be at least somewhat accurate).\n\nIt\'s hard to judge any of the acting, because the writing and direction are so uneven and mediocre. Overall, this felt like a decent made-for-TV movie. The plot, direction and acting were on par with a predictable TV crime drama.\n\n5 out of 10 from me.

Well, it turns out sweet little Evelyn was foster mom for four tough guys who were so mean as kids she was the only person willing to take them on. They may be less than model citizens now, but they\'d probably not even be alive if it hadn\'t been for Evelyn Mercer. So when the Mercer boys -- Bobby (Mark Wahlberg) and young Jack (Garrett Hedlund), who\'re white, and Angel (Tyrese Gibson) and Jeremiah (Andre Benjamin) who\'re black -- all come back together for the funeral and get hints that Evelyn was deliberately assassinated and not just caught in the crossfire, they go into action. When one of the brothers may have had involvement in the hit, the plot and the emotions get more complicated.\n\nOnce again as in James Gray\'s richly atmospheric and brooding and admittedly far superior 2000 movie \"The Yards,\" Mark Wahlberg stars in a story about a doomed gangsterish family whose sins he tries to unearth and cleanse. The special charm of the male bonding is in the multi-racial brotherhood, which Singleton and the actors manage to inject a lot of warmth into. These guys are soulful, whether black or white. Not only is the sound track rich in Motown classics, but the brothers cry a lot.\n\nThere are conscious allusions to \"Mystic River\" with its deep bonds, buried traumas, childhood street hockey games, and clapboard houses -- though this is Detroit, not Massachusetts. The sense of place, in fact, may waver; but the memories and loyalty don\'t. It\'s Thanksgiving, and the men stay at the old house, where the memories start the tears flowing. A turkey is baked and drinks are poured but the brothers aren\'t hungry. Bobby gets them to go out and play hockey.\n\nNext day a little investigation brings on the suspicions of a contract hit against their foster mom. Though Jeremiah objects, Bobby remains in charge. Jerry\'s relative respectability does not convey any influence in this family; his hesitancy about revenge already makes him seem disloyal. Right away at least three, and sometimes four, of the Mercer boys are in full attack mode and before you can say \"assault weapon,\" the screen is littered with the bodies of cheap gangsters, crooked cops, and gangster politicos. \"Hell, this is Detroit,\" somebody insists. Heads are smashed and weapons multiply, falling into the brothers\' hands by the trunk load. Two detectives are watching all this -- one of them played by Terrence Howard, who\'s so great in \"Hustle and Flow\" -- and as in another better movie, Joe Carnahan\'s 2002 \"Narc,\" an element of corruption and betrayal comes in from that angle as well.\n\nJeremiah claimed his reluctance to participate had moral and filial grounds: he said blood revenge was the last thing Evelyn would have wanted her death to bring about. But you wouldn\'t have been reading the movie very well if you thought he was the one we must listen to. Before long rumors link him with some insurance and a payoff that put his loyalty in doubt. But is he really a rotten apple, or just a bad businessmen? Suspicion falls inside and outside the family. Don\'t worry, if you\'re going to see \"Four Brothers,\" reading this review won\'t spoil it for you. I\'m not going to tell you what the movie\'s secrets are. Hell, they were so twisted, I\'m not sure I really understood them anyway. But this is an urban thriller, or if you like a ghetto western, and the procedural details aren\'t what it\'s about. It\'s about emotion, it\'s about action, it\'s about getting the bad guys. And the worst bad guy gets his comeuppance starkly and satisfyingly out on a sheet of ice. It\'s a nice detail that his gangster crew revolt because trade union experience makes them realize he\'s an abusive employer. Of course he\'s worse than that. He\'s a sadistic creep.\n\nThe critics are right: this isn\'t a great movie. At moments it\'s not even a very good one. The chief villain\'s a little too villainous. The Nigerian-descent English actor Chiwetel Ejiofor (of Stephen Frears\'s 2002 \"Dirty Pretty Things\"), who plays him, is out of his element (maybe he took the role for a change of pace). The plot\'s too tangled. The cops are too complicit, even for Detroit.\n\nStill, there\'s something that\'s underlyingly okay about \"Four Brothers.\" Singleton is returning to the roots of his film-making, the ghetto and its destructive effects on young black men, which he memorably depicted in his 1991 \"Boyz N the Hood.\" Mark Wahlberg\'s presence here feels right. Everybody\'s having a good time, which is something that should happen more often. There\'s nothing wrong with a dose of warm interracial male bonding, with tears and shootouts, every now and again. It can get you through a slow day. Unlike Cinderella Man\'s, this movies\' snow looks pretty real. So do the women\'s ample cleavage. The movie\'s action is not convincing, but the atmosphere and people often are. There are a hell of a lot of weapons and gunshots in this movie, and a house gets turned into Swiss cheese like in the shootouts in \"L.A. Confidential\" and \"Mr. and Mrs. Smith.\" \"Four Brothers\" is as lurid as the first and as fantastic as the second; but it still hurts when one of the brothers is lost, even if he goes with a sweet smile on his face.'),(838,49,'7/10','Nice little action flick','quinn18','12 August 2005','I saw this movie August 12, the day it came out and I liked it.This is a nice action movie and probably the best action movie of 2005.But I don\'t understand the \"R\" rated it should be rated 14A because there nothing serious in it except for language and action but action is what most of the kids 14 and older prefers for movies.\n\n**SPOILER IN THIS PARAGRAPH**\n\nIn this movie every thing was perfect like the action scenes.The actors all did a perfect job.But the only thing I did not like is the fight scene between Bobby Mercer (Mark Wahlberg) and Victor Sweet (Chiwetel Ejiofor) at the end of the movie because the camera was moving too much and it was going around people and behind wild the camera could\'ve just stayed in the middle of the circle.You have a hard time keeping your eyes on the fight scene.\n\nBut anyway this is a good movie and anyway who is an action fan should go see it, it\'s worth watching.'),(839,49,'7/10','Four Reasons Why This Movie is Good','T1Thousand','18 August 2005','All right, how many of us would actually expect a movie like this to be good or above average? I mean, many urban flicks or street revenge types are usually just average, so-so. But this, I must say, is a good one. The story was catching enough as it is. It might be typical or mindless at times, but it has its funny moments, its tense moments, and parts where you will be at the edge of your seat. There is really not much bad to say about this movie except that maybe the end could have been better and certain parts could have been delivered differently. But there are four reasons (perhaps more) why this movie is good--four main reasons at that. The first one is already mentioned--about the story being catching and so on. The second reason is because in this movie you get a feel of how close these brothers really are, regardless of their differences of race. You see them together as a family and act like everyday brothers when they\'re not out beating people up. And with that said, the third reason is how convincing the actors are, especially Wahlberg. I have seen him in plenty of movies, but now I think I will see him as the bad boy, hot-headed Bobby from this. He did a very well job as did the rest of the cast. The final reason why this movie is good is because it stays to what it is. It does not stray, suddenly become an intense drama or overly done comedy, etc. I think you know where I\'m going here. This movie stays as what it is supposed to be--an urban revenge flick. Other movies like this take whole different route and stray from the story. I was afraid this would do the same, especially when it started explaining why everything happened. But I am happy to say that I am not disappointed. If you are into these types of movies, I\'m sure you will feel the same.

There are unexpected scenes in this movie that made me laugh so hard my nose blew my slurpy back in the cup (I did not finish the slurpy after that). The chemistry that all 4 of the brothers had on screen was unmatched. To be honest, I thought the downfall of the movie was going to be Andre 3000. I was wrong. He was actually pretty good in his role. Having two brothers myself, I could relate to a lot of the bickering and arguing that the 4 brothers go through. This movie has great comedy, intense drama, sweet action, and a lot of Mark Wahlberg fighting. And I have now decided that a movie with Mark Wahlberg can not be good unless he punches someone in the face a few times. I mean, let\'s be honest, he\'s really good at that. John Singleton deserves a lot of credit too. Considering that the casting was perfect, the story was very interesting, and the acting was far better than I had imagined, I think Singleton did a fine job. Even if you disagree with the above, you cannot disagree that Singleton has a unique way of making innocent faces, like Tyrese and Andre 3000, and making them tough guys with an edge. Don\'t hold it against him that he worked with Paul Walker in 2 Fast 2 Furious. Remember that he did create Cuba Gooding Jr.\'s career. All in all this movie was very entertaining and fun. 4 Brothers is definitely one that you should go see if you like revenge stories and want to see a great mixture of comedy, drama, and action (and who wants to miss Mark pound faces in?).'),(843,49,'8/10','Like revenge flicks?','forhall','13 August 2005','I\'ve always loved revenge movies, and this one fits the bill because it has four brothers trying to find out the truth of their mother\'s murder.

The 8 minute AOL trailer on the movies sold me. Also superb is Terrence Howard as a Detroit cop who doesn\'t trust his own who is desperately trying to find out what happened himself.

It seemed like the usual stick up by racist hoodlums on the hard streets of Detriot, and that the lady was collateral damage.\n\nFour orphaned brothers of the hood are brought back together to mourn the loss of their foster mother. We see the Mercer brothers Bobby, Angel, Jeremiah and Jack, bond together as they try not to openly weep. But deep down inside, they know the police can\'t do much to help a covered-up investigation, and swear sweet revenge upon those involved in the killing.\n\nI was expecting loads of gun battles and intense action, but this movie surprised me with its witty moments instead. There weren\'t much wham-bang action, but the one which stood out was the ambush on the Mercer house, and the car chase sequence along frozen streets. The script was mildly intelligent with its weaving of the brothers\' dalliances with the hoodlums, contract killers, government officers, and with crooked cops, bringing them all together for an interesting finale.\n\nThe last Mark Wahlberg movie I saw was The Italian Job remake, and here, Wahlberg reigns as he personifies the cocky hotheaded Bobby Mercer. Andre Benjamin seemed somewhat muted too, after his recent screen stint as a flamboyant and trigger-happy gangster in Be Cool. Perhaps it is his role as the family man which adds that extra dimension and difference between him and the rest of the brothers - he can\'t be as carefree or act with total disregard as he has people who depend on him.\n\nThis film also makes no apologies in adding that bit of realism to its dialogue, with street language and cursing aplenty, with plenty of stereotypical characters.\n\nBut all in all, it\'s an enjoyable flick, as we observe in silent glee, the four brothers exacting revenge with R&B music humming along in the background.'),(845,49,'9/10','Four Brothers = EXCELLENT','rockprincess173','13 August 2005','OK, I\'m a girl who normally loves \"chick flicks\" and comedies, so when I had nothing to do this evening and decided to go see a movie with my parents, (I thought they were seeing \"Deuce Bigalow: European Gigalo\"...but alas I was incorrect.) and discovered we were going to see \"Four Brothers\", I was a little upset. I\'m normally not one for movies that are seemingly all about people getting revenge and lots of killing and fighting. I dunno..I\'m not one for the action/drama type...unless it\'s a horror movie, and then I\'m definitely there. Anyways, I was genuinely surprised at how good this movie ended up being. Each of the four brothers gave an amazing performance. Andre Benjamin showed that he\'s not only a talented singer, but a talented actor as well.\n\nThe movie was much better than I had expected. I laughed, and I (almost) cried. It went through a range of so many different emotions and events in the lives of the four troubled men, all adopted when they were children by one amazing woman who became their world.

Its novice director, John Singleton, has languished in relative obscurity since then and revisits a similar turf with his revenge drama, Four Brothers. While it reconfirms Singleton\'s talents, it is an imperfect action drama that leans too heavily on its mean spirited revenge theme.\n\nA middle aged woman, Evelyn Mercer (Fionnula Flanagan), is known for taking wayward boys off the streets and finding them foster homes. Yet, over time, only four boys could not be placed, and she adopted them herself. Years later, when a liquor store robbery goes awry, Evelyn is murdered. This reunites the four brothers who are now grown (Mark Wahlberg, Tyrese Gibson, Andre Benjamin, and Garrett Hedlund). What seems to be a simple crime gone wrong is only the beginning of a tale of conspiracy and betrayal. With police detectives (Terrence Howard and Josh Charles) seemingly a step behind the clues, the brothers decide to find the answers and punish all those involved even if it leads to corrupt officials, crooked cops, or the top crime boss in town. This causes violent confrontations and retribution until the brothers must attempt a daring plan to avenge their family and bring the murderers to their form of justice.\n\nAs portrayed by Singleton, this is a tough, violent neighborhood, a sort of distant cousin to the one in Boyz n the Hood. There are some similarities with New Jack City with its family of gangsters and a ruthless leader. The film does contain well directed scenes. The pool hall scene between Howard and Charles is quite good and the dialogue makes this a mini-gem. At times Singleton knows enough to reel back his characters from a pure revenge tale to one of family and connection. There is a good early scene during Thanksgiving at the dinner table where each brother looks upon the memory and visage of his deceased mother in an empty chair and remembers the lessons she instilled in them. It is a clever moment and speaks volumes on what she meant to each son. Perhaps a bit more of this would have balanced the film and kept it from turning into the overwhelmingly vengeful tale it ultimately becomes.\n\nThe film feels tough and gritty, and its characters are real people with real conflicts and emotions. The relationship of these brothers forms the backbone of the film no matter what they endure. They stick up for each other and watch each other\'s back. These brothers in arms love each other and fight amongst themselves. We anguish when they suffer and cheer when they triumph. There are humorous moments sprinkled throughout the film and some funny lines spoken at the expense of each character.\n\nThe story, written by David Elliot and Paul Lovett, works on a couple of levels. On one level, it is a detective story with twists and turns and some surprises. There are some clues and red herrings along the way, and you don\'t quite know the whole story until the end. On another level it functions as a kind of urban western with its revenge tale. In fact the film is essentially structured similarly to fraternal, revenge westerns as The Sons of Katie Elder and Gunfight at the OK Corral. It\'s also about the love given by a selfless mother who gave comfort and hope to four wayward rejects when no one wanted them.\n\nThe ending is a little like an urban Mission Impossible with its elaborate ruse. Some of it is implausible but on the whole the sequence works marginally. We don\'t know much about Jeremiah Mercer\'s family which would have added to our attachment to his character.\n\nMark Wahlberg is an imposing figure who will stop at nothing to find his mother\'s killer.\n\nIn fact all four leads are quite strong and well cast. Terrence Howard (who has starred in a number of strong films this year and is a star on the rise for sure) has an effective role as a good cop although his character leaves too early as the conspiracy widens. Fionnula Flanagan is seen too briefly and should have been used more which would have grounded the film morally.\n\nThe soundtrack is a good mixture of oldies and serves as the pulse of the kinetic action scenes in the Motown setting. Technical credits for what is essentially a low budget film are solid especially in the cinematography and film editing.\n\nIt is entirely possible to be shell shocked by the hard hitting nature of this violent melodrama by film\'s end. It\'s certainly a crowd pleaser and almost manipulative in the way it generates deep feelings. The film succeeds in terms of sheer energy and force. It\'s a little rough around the edges but still a welcome return to Singleton\'s roots. While Four Brothers proves that his previous abilities were no fluke, he has yet to exceed let alone match the promise of his first film.'),(847,50,'10/10','Is it possible the makers understand how incredible this film is?','srcooper-756-646671','22 December 2020','You only get to watch this for the first time once, so choose your state of mind carefully.

Dom Cobb, the main protagonist, is an extractor who is able to find out people\'s secrets by intruding into their dreams. His right-hand is Arthur, who researches and plans what they are trying to accomplish in a dream. Bright graduate student Ariadne is the architect for the dreams, meaning she literally constructs the physical aspects of a dreamscape. Eames is a professional at turning into anyone else in a dream, almost like shapeshifting. Lastly, Yusuf is a chemist who creates perfect concoctions of sedatives to achieve ideal conditions for the dreams to take place. This elaborate combination of characters is asked by a rich businessman, Saito, to infiltrate his dying competitor\'s son, Robert Fischer\'s, dream and place an idea in his mind so that Saito\'s business can become more successful. Traveling through the layers of someone\'s mind and making them think of an idea on their own is what they call \"inception.\" Cobb is dedicated to making this happen so that Saito can arrange for Cobb\'s return to America to see his children. Without Saito, Cobb would not be able to return to America because of his alleged criminal background, but Saito has connections and power to clear his name. Some members of his team think achieving inception is impossible, but Cobb convinces them to be on board and they must come up with a mastermind plan with no room for error to achieve this extremely difficult yet imperative task. They begin a three-layer plan that involves elaborate depths of the dream dimension, taking advantage of Fischer\'s sensitive and dysfunctional relationship with his father, practiced methods of leaving a dream and entering the next, all while trying to avoid Cobb\'s wife Mal who lives in his subconscious and often sabotages his plans. The shocking ending leaves viewers at a cliffhanger and fans theorizing.\n\nNow that I\'ve gone over the plot, let\'s talk about the other components of the film. The marketing strategies did an excellent job gathering hype for the film. The movie poster features the famous actors that everyone was excited to see, Leonardo DiCaprio, Tom Hardy, Elliot Page, and the rest of the dream crew. It also says \"Inception\" in a large red font and notes that is directed by the same director of \"Dark Knight,\" which was an insanely successful and highly rated movie that was premiered two years prior to Inception. Dark Knight scored a 94% on rotten tomatoes and is #112 on IMBD\'s most popular movie list. This likely drew in the audience from Christopher Nolan\'s movies and set a high expectation for the quality of Inception. Another great marketing move was the contents of the teaser trailer. The trailer features a brief voiceover of Leonardo DiCaprio and amazing scenes with impressive cinematography taken out of context that show the viewers the production value and exciting action contents of the film all while confusing them so that they go see the film when it is released. I think the shock factor and science fiction aspect of the trailer is owed to the scene where a city block starts to fold over top of itself.\n\nThe content of the film stayed true to the marketing because the cinematography, directing, and acting is quite well-done. Starting with the cinematography, the zero gravity scenes and cityscape building from the ground up were very realistic looking and intensified the movie watching experience. There was a lot of attention to detail. The directing of Inception is very montage based. It draws amounts and amounts of suspense. For example, the montage near the end of the film with the van, the fortress, and the hotel was painfully long but created such thick suspense. For the acting, I only have compliments and no complaints. Inception was casted beautifully and everyone fit their roles perfectly. Leonardo DiCaprio did an excellent job as Dom Cobb, especially in the emotional scene with his wife and two kids in one of the dreams. My personal favorite performance was Cillian Murphy\'s role as Robert Fischer. He played as his character really well and he captured his relatively constant sadness surrounding his father situation.\n\nInception is a staple film in the science fiction genre and is similar to a few other sci-fi movies as well. Inception is at #135 on IMBD\'s most popular movie list and has a rating of 87% on rotten tomatoes, so there is no doubt about its quality. In my opinion, Inception is pretty similar to the well-loved movie \"The Matrix\" (1999) starring Keanu Reeves. They are both iconic science fiction and action films with themes of alternate realities. The second film I think is very similar is a more recent film, Tenet (2020) with Robert Pattinson. Tenet is also about bending the rules of science and is also directed by Christopher Nolan. If you enjoyed either of these movies, I recommend Inception. I also recommend it to general fans of Christopher Nolan\'s directing, so if you have watched and enjoyed any of his films, you would probably like Inception too.\n\nOn my rating scale of one to five, with one being the worst possible score and five being perfect, I give Inception a five. It has no weaknesses in my opinion. Every aspect of this movie combines into perfection. The acting and cinematography is what takes it over the top, and I am a fan of Leonardo DiCaprio and Cillian Murphy in all of the roles they play. This is a movie I have voluntarily watched multiple times and it only gets better with each watch. It is very complex and a complete experience to view. My favorite aspect of the film is the ending. Many people say they hate cliffhangers, but I enjoy them because it leaves it up to the audience to imagine. Basically, you can choose your own ending based on what you think makes the most sense with the facts you are given in the film.'),(854,50,'10/10','Nolan at his most intelligent best.','marcusdean118','13 July 2010','Inception is truly one of a kind. A concept which has long gestated in Christopher Nolan\'s mind, his eye for drama mixed with his large scale sensibilities ring true in Blockbuster season making Inception a true original in the sea of reboots, remakes and sequels.\n\nTo try and explain Inceptions many plot twists and incredibly intelligent arcs, would be a foolish task. As Nolan himself has been reluctant to. The best way to approach the film would be with an open mind, if you are prepared to be taken on a ride of a lifetime, then trust that you 100% will. If Avatar was a seminal film in technology (although coming out as a rather poor film, in my opinion), then Inception is seminal in it\'s storytelling. With a 148 minute running time, you would expect a lot to take place, but what you wouldn\'t expect is the pace of it all. I did not think at one time in the film about how long was left. I was simply blown away by the depth in every single part of the film. If my enthusiasm for the storytelling aspect of the film has left you worried about the spectacle, then don\'t worry. They are, as hinted in the trailer, incredible, looking real and unbelievable simultaneously. The most pleasing thing about the action set pieces, is that they are genuinely used to illustrate the story, rather than to blow stuff up a la Michael Bay.\n\nWith this complex movie in it\'s high concept, a stellar cast is needed. And Nolan as always, delivers with just that. This is vintage DiCaprio, perhaps only equalled in The Aviator, which is even more impressive as his role as Cobb in Inception is not a showy one, needing DiCaprio to be the constant at the centre of the film. And he pulls off Cobb\'s emotional contradictions sublimely. The rest of the cast members all shine in parts of the films, Cillian Murphy shows off his usually non-existent tender side, Gordon-Levitt bottles his usual charm for his confidently reserved turn as the reliable Arthur, Watanabe is devilish as the seemingly ambiguous Saito, Page shows why she\'s the next big female star and Tom Hardy revels in being the comic relief of the film compared to his recent turns as decidedly psychopathic characters.\n\nOverall, Nolan has indeed surpassed himself. He has created a world as expansive as his Gotham, a plot dwarfing the intricacies of Memento and one which blows The Prestige\'s cinematic reveal out of the water. This is truly unmissable cinema. Revel in it, we\'ve still got to wait a whole two years before Batman 3.'),(855,50,'10/10','My number one favorite movie','lhbaker-28783','4 June 2021','Inception is my number one favorite movie off my twelve years on earth!

The directing was outstanding, there were only about two moments, maybe three seconds in total, where i noticed that visual effects were being used (of course defying gravity is pretty difficult).\n\nThe plot was very pleasingly intricate, with a twist-and-turn, keep-you-on-the-edge-of-your-seat type feel. I noticed that this film had similarities with DiCaprios thriller Shutter Island (which i also enjoyed very much)seeing as it left you wondering what was real and what was not. It\'s great to see a movie with a thick and emotional plot and not just grenade-throwing action heroes who achieve greatness in the end.\n\nInception also has a very well-composed score, which to me was the finishing touch to a perfect movie. If you\'re thinking about seeing Inception, definitely go! Even though i was fortunate enough to see a free show, it is worth every penny you pay.\n\nTruly unique, like nothing i\'ve ever seen before. Christopher Nolan certainly covered new ground with this film and wasn\'t afraid to leave us hanging with a spectacular ending.'),(858,50,'10/10','Nolan\'s first true masterpiece','technofunkie','12 July 2010','Usually I try to be careful with over hyping a film, or setting the expectations too high, as film geeks all are guilty for, however for Christopher Nolan\'s Inception, this really is not possible.\n\nThis is possibly one of the only perfect films I have ever seen. It is absolutely confident in every way, something which is extremely refreshing, even more so than Avatar. Christopher Nolan gets some slack for making great to look at but ultimately heartless affairs, which I for one do not agree with, however I do not think anyone can argue that here. The emotional aspect of this film not only ties it all together but is really the centre of this film, it is the focus.\n\nI do not want to over simplify the film, by simply calling it Kubrick doing Bond, or Gondry on a huge budget, because I am sure it will be called that but it is far more than that, it is something I do not think Kubrick could have ever made. It is pure Nolan, and pure greatness.\n\nI hate writing something which is pure fan-boy gushing, but its really difficult here. I did not find a thing I did not like about it, I am sure if maybe I saw it a second time, maybe I would find something about it I didn\'t like, but not the first time. The way it is cut, means that there is always action on screen, if not, then the visuals are interesting enough to keep your eyes glued.\n\nThe final hour of the film, is possibly one of the most complicated action sequences put on film. You have to constantly be paying attention to remember all of the layers of what is happening. Without spoiling anything, all I have to say is that is what this film is about, that is what makes this film so great, layers. Once you have seen this you will now what I am talking about.\n\nAll of the actors are fantastic too, Di Caprio is the stand out here. Yes, this is probably due to the fact he is the star and given all of the emotional weight, but he handles it perfectly, similarly to his performance in Shutter Island. Ellen Page, whom I usually hate, gives a great performance here. Tom Hardy gives a break out performance here, he is quite the bad ass.\n\nI hope audiences are ready for a film like this, a pure auteur driven film which does not sacrifice a single frame for the studio. I would hope this film will change Hollywood, as it is 100 percent the directors vision yet it is definitely a marketable film, much like District 9, yet I do not think it will.\n\nI cannot recommend this film anymore than I have, I just have to say everyone and anyone should see it. Sorry about all the gushing, it is just so hard not too.\n\nIf you liked this review check out my new film blog: http://thedeletedscene.wordpress.com'),(859,50,'8/10','Sci-fi perfection. A truly mesmerizing film.','dvc5159','15 July 2010','I\'m nearly at a loss for words. Just when you thought Christopher Nolan couldn\'t follow up to \"The Dark Knight\", he does it again, delivering another masterpiece, one with so much power and rich themes that has been lost from the box office for several years. Questioning illusions vs reality usually makes the film weird, but Nolan grips your attention like an iron claw that you just can\'t help watching and wondering what will happen next. That is a real powerful skill a director has. No wonder Warner Bros. put their trust in him, he is THAT good of a director, and over-hyping a Christopher Nolan film, no matter what the film is about, is always an understatement instead of an overestimate like MANY films before.\n\nNot since the eras of Stanley Kubrick, Andrei Tarkovsky and Alfred Hitchcock has there been a more brilliant director than Christopher Nolan. He is, undoubtedly, one of THE most brilliant and gifted Hollywood filmmakers in history. Filmmakers like him come but just once in a lifetime. He has the ability to seduce our eyes, ears and most importantly, mind, and then delivers what he intends to deliver in full blast. Rarely have blockbusters have the gall to deliver such amounts imagination and intelligence at the same time. And yes, it is similar to the excellent anime film \"Paprika\" in the whole \"invading dreams\" plot, but the similarities end there as Nolan brings the film to a whole different level.\n\nVisuals and intelligence rarely come together in movies at the same time, it\'s either all-visuals-no-smarts (\"G.I. Joe\", \"Transformers\") or the exact opposite (\"Doubt\", \"Invictus\"). In this film the excellently directed action sequences combined with immensely groundbreaking and jaw-dropping visual effects are combined smoothly with a heavy dose of intelligence and believability.\n\nAlthough having an ensemble cast and financed by a Hollywood giant studio (Warner Bros), this film is a very personal film for Nolan, he wrote the film as well as directing it, and as you watch the film you get many glimpses of Nolan\'s perplexing, increasingly imaginative thoughts and dreams in the dialog that he writes and the plot that he sets up. Ideas have never felt more interesting and put to good use than in this film. This film is NOT for the popcorn muncher, rather it is a film for thinkers. Honestly I can\'t explain the plot for fear of spoiling the movie for you readers. Even the slightest hint will ruin the experience. The viewer will walk out of the cinema feeling dazed, confused and ultimately breathless. It\'s like a puzzle, both physically and mentally, and you have to pay attention throughout the film for the clues. However Nolan controls the spectacle of the film and is careful not to let it overwhelm the film\'s humanity, and this is where \"Inception\" shines. It is a very deep film that will have one thinking and asking questions for years to come. That\'s right, years.\n\nOnce the film ends, you\'ll want to watch it again, for there\'s something new every time. This is a film that requires multiple viewing for someone to truly comprehend the film\'s ambiguous themes, and will be discussed by many in the future. This is an original film, no adaptation, no sequel/prequel, no remake/reboot, which is extremely refreshing having gone nearly three years of mostly unremarkable visual effects roadshows (\"Avatar\" be damned).\n\nOf course, a film is not complete without the actors. Leo DiCaprio delivers an Oscar worthy performance, similar but better than his previous effort \"Shutter Island\". He shows glimpses of a flawed, grim, fragile man, who has knowledge about everything else but yet can\'t seem to come in grips with himself and his demons. Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Ellen Page, Tom Hardy, Ken Watanabe, Dileep Rao, Cillian Murphy, Tom Berenger, Michael Caine, Marion Cottilard, Pete Postlethwaite, Lukas Haas... Nolan really brings out the best in this unusual yet extremely talented group of supporting actors who make their roles their own.\n\nNolan is of course, a master behind the camera, a real virtuoso when it comes to film. His direction is taut, focused, gripping, and extraordinarily fascinating. The detailed and complex original script is no surprise from Nolan, considering the fact that he turned Batman the superhero into pop-culture art two years ago (\"The Dark Knight\"). The action sequences are unique, exciting and fresh, something absent from the cinema which has since been interested at things popping towards the screen and stuff blowing up every two milliseconds. The visual effects are awesome and imaginative, and best of all they do not bring down the movie\'s quality one bit, rather it makes the movie more fascinating to watch. The cinematography is absolutely, beautifully shot, so we can see the action and emotion in all their glory. Production design is top notch, with terrific design of sets and locations. Hans Zimmer\'s complementing music score is simply outstanding, and knowing the man, that\'s really all I have to say. Together all of these elements combine to deliver a mesmerizing movie experience like no other this year.\n\nChristopher Nolan has once again outdone himself. He truly is a gifted filmmaker, arguably the most imaginative in Hollywood today. And \"Inception\" can proudly stand alongside \"Blade Runner\" and \"2001: A Space Odyssey\" as science-fiction masterpieces that push the boundaries for movie making and become a different experience altogether.\n\nThere are two types of films: the crowd-pleasing blockbuster and the intelligent indie/art film. Nolan has combined two of these tropes together into one exceptionally brilliant package, pulling off that rare, now nearly-extinct Movie Magic that has since been wiped off the planet by sequelitis and reboots. Movie of Summer 2010? Movie of 2010? Heck this is possibly the first masterpiece of the decade! Nolan is a genius and I applaud him for treating his audiences as intelligent people.\n\nMissing this film and not getting the film\'s point is a crime.\n\nOverall value: 9/10 (Excellent)'),(860,50,'9/10','Intellectual masterpiece','akdjreview','23 November 2021','Inception is a beautiful piece of film that has impacted a large part of the film industry.

It begins intensely to then slows down for the next 20 - 30 minutes. While then finishing off as an impeccable film. Nevertheless, this is what brings the film down for me.\n\nThe director Christopher Nolan managed to create a masterpiece with little to no mistakes. At no point during this intensely long movie did I feel bored. Instead, I was always excited and on my toes intrigued.\n\nThe acting in this movie was phenomenal. A small number of great actors that all had their character arc while also doing incredible performances. It is truly beyond me how Dicaprio didn\'t win an Oscar for his performance.\n\nMeanwhile, also employing the greatest composer in history with Hans Zimmer, the music adds significantly. The music adds an extreme amount of excitement and keeps you constantly interested. Few composers can make you notice the music, but Zimmer succeeds per usual.\n\nTo finish of the film was astonishingly shot. With beautiful eye-catching scenes. While also containing some incredible action scenes that might be some of the best action I\'ve seen.

The story isn\'t groundbreaking, but it does the trick and the same goes for the action which isn\'t bad either. The greatness of this film lies in its humor and its uniqueness. It isn\'t like every other superhero film. Whether you talk about the constant breaking of the fourth wall, the R-rating, or any of the very different characteristics of this film that differentiate it from other superhero movies. To be frank, it\'s arguable doesn\'t even justify the \"superhero\" stamp. It\'s something different.\n\nIt needs to be said, the film might not be for everyone. It\'s very crude and it\'s filled with nudity and violence. The humor won\'t appeal to everyone either. It\'s quite dark sometimes and very satirical. Sure, \"Deadpool\" isn\'t for everyone, but to the right audience, it\'s a masterpiece. The humor is great and there are countless hilarious jokes throughout that will make you laugh. Ryan Reynolds is perfect for Deadpool and he does so well in the role. It is a truly great performance by him.\n\nTo sum up, \"Deadpool\" is a great film that might not be for everyone. I recommend it.'),(863,51,'8/10','\"Please don\'t make the super suit green...or animated!\"','adamsmith-51004','16 April 2021','One of the greatest anti-hero - the Merc with a mouth - Wade Wilson was once a special forces operative but turned mercenary. After being subjected to a rogue experiment, he finds himself with accelerated healing and transforms himself into Deadpool. Armed with weapons (and a wicked sense of humour) he will stop at nothing to track down the men responsible.\n\nNever have I seen so many fans (or moviegoers), dying to see a character like Deadpool on the big screen; it\'s a bit like how everyone wanted to see The Avengers on the big screen back in late 2011. It\'s bad enough that the studios can\'t seem to get the character right with the disaster that was X-Men Origins: Wolverine. But the respect and love that fans have for this character stayed strong until everyone\'s prays was finally answered by this movie. And it did not disappoint, because Deadpool lives up to hype by being entertaining and hilarious. While I don\'t think it is a masterpiece of all comic book movies I did have fun watching this movie. It\'s a film that fans wanted and got.\n\nI can\'t imagine anyone else in Hollywood playing Deadpool but only Ryan Reynolds. He was born to play this character and he\'s the only actor that I think of to do the character justice. Reynolds as expected did that, and has made the character of Deadpool his own. He was terrific as the mouth talking, ant-hero bad-ass. This is Ryan Reynolds come back role after his past disasters roles that mostly involves Green Lantern and Origins Wolverine (that this movie brilliantly makes fun off). Reynolds was just perfect for this character and he did a great performance in this film. He delivered the comedic timing and the somewhat of a hidden charm that Deadpool has. Ryan Reynolds absolutely nailed it.\n\nThe writing in this movie was surprisingly good, which I didn\'t expect for a movie with this kind of character. Of course there are Easter eggs, references and nods to the comics and Marvel movies, but in this movie it\'s done in such a way that feels kind of refreshing. I know for a fact that I missed a lot of the jokes and references due to amount of laughter that I had while watching the movie. I can say it with a brave face that the writing is this movies biggest strength, because it\'s self awareness on Marvel movies and itself was all top notch.\n\nI\'m so happy that this movie is rated 18 and not some watered down movie, because if you honestly think a Deadpool movie should be rated anything less then you really don\'t know the character at all.'),(864,51,'8/10','One of my favourite comedy\'s','ethanjjacobs','15 May 2021','I really enjoyed this movie and I didn\'t expect to, I don\'t really enjoy a lot of \'superhero\' movies so I didn\'t have high hopes , but this movie was amazing.

Sign in to vote.','I really, really liked Deadpool. And you know what? I didn\'t expect to. Seriously, I was never a fan of the character (in the sense that I hardly knew anything about him) and the humor as well as the violence seemed forced and overdone in the trailers. Still, I remained interested in the film, I just never expected it to actually be good - until the reviews arrived. After most critics unexpectedly showered this newest superhero movie with praise, I went in cautiously optimistic (but still fully prepared to hate the film).\n\nThe first thing I noticed was how inventive the storytelling is. The film throws you into the action from the first moment (literally: the very first moment) and then it goes back and forth in brilliant and unexpected ways to slowly unspool the story of this insane - but oddly charming - antihero. Flashbacks and fast-forwards can be annoying as hell, but when done right, they can help render even a somewhat simple story fresh and exciting. And that\'s exactly how Deadpool felt to me right from the start: like a fresh (if somewhat dirty) jolt of energy.\n\nThe action itself is beautifully designed, employing playful visuals and using pretty much every camera technique available; it never feels repetitive and the pacing is close to perfection. But, and that was probably the key to me liking the film so much, there\'s a beating heart underneath all the action and carnage, and that has a lot to do with how brilliantly Ryan Reynolds portrays the character and the great chemistry he has with co-star Morena Baccarin. What came as a complete surprise to me was how unabashedly romantic Deadpool is. The love story in this film is probably the most sincere I\'ve ever seen in a superhero movie and it gives the film the strong emotional core which so many of these movies lack.\n\nThe humor, which I initially feared would just be non-stop juvenile wisecracks and soon become distracting, also works surprisingly well. Not every line or every joke lands - but that\'s the beauty of this character: they don\'t really need to. Deadpool can\'t help himself; as long as he\'s able to breathe he\'ll crack wise and make fun of himself and those around him. It\'s a clinical condition; he\'s not a stand-up comedian whose jokes need to land: he\'s a madman (albeit a very entertaining one) and the comedy in his case is born out of tragedy.\n\nDespite all my praise, it\'s not a perfect film. The villain in this revenge tale could be more memorable and the story itself is a bit too derivative to really do its highly unconventional protagonist (he insists he\'s not a hero) justice: but it\'s a damn good first entry in a franchise that will hopefully explore the character and his world to a much larger extent in the sequel(s). And it\'s actually a very important film for another reason. If Deadpool is a financial success - which at this point is already clear it will be - this could play a vital role in how studios henceforth view the financial prospects of R-rated superhero films, and we\'ll hopefully see more of them in the future.\n\nMany people might feel different - and I respect their opinion - but I\'ve grown tired of the entirely bloodless CGI overkill in all those 200 million productions where even the most terrible villains talk like Mormon schoolgirls. I mean: there\'s a gigantic audience out there that is over the age of 18, loves to read comic books and can absolutely handle real-world language, real-world sex and real-world violence in superhero movies. This genre is so diverse; it\'s ridiculous to believe just because comic books have pictures in them all film adaptations - regardless of the material - must automatically be made for kids in order to be successful.\n\nAs it is, I think Deadpool - a dirty, funny, sexy and violent film which is decidedly NOT for kids - just proved my point perfectly. 8 stars out of 10.\n\nFavorite films: IMDb.com/list/mkjOKvqlSBs/\n\nLesser-Known Masterpieces: imdb.com/list/ls070242495/\n\nFavorite Low-Budget and B-Movies: imdb.com/list/ls054808375/\n\nFavorite TV-Shows reviewed: imdb.com/list/ls075552387/'),(866,51,'9/10','\"Bad Deadpool - Good Deadpool Film!\"','asifahsankhan','14 December 2016','If anyone else could be cast to play Deadpool, he certainly doesn\'t exist in this universe. After Ryan Reynolds\'s dramatic failure in the Green Lantern film, he has returned to the comic book world. Reynolds is absolutely phenomenal as the foul mouthed, and witty anti hero. I mean he is just superb! He completely owns the role, and gives a fantastic performance. If Robert Downey Jr. IS Iron Man, then Ryan Reynolds IS Deadpool. He is also such a liveable character, and by the end of the film, I genuinely cared about Deadpool. I never thought I\'d say that. All of the performances are great. No one holds a candle to Reynolds, but I will say not one person was miscast here.\n\nDeadpool is a unique film, and a huge gamble. Both Marvel and the studios bringing us this film took a major risk. This is a beloved character, and his world is very different than other Marvel films. Right off the bat, this film is consciously self-aware. It knows its a comic book film with comic book characters, and it actually exploits it. Many times, Deadpool turns to the audience and tells us what we\'re all thinking. It was so different, and it worked so very well. The narrative itself is also different. It\'s very non-linear. The events of the film don\'t play out in a normal straight narrative.\n\nOne of the trademarks, nay, the trademark of Deadpool is his sense of humour. This film is by far one of the most hysterical films I have seen in some time. The writing is so perfect, so sharp, and so full of witty banter, and thankfully, it all works. Not one joke, that I remember, fell flat. The film had me laughing constantly; from the opening credits, all the way to the after credits scene.\n\nAs for the action, it\'s also very satisfying. Many action films today are butchered by terrible camera work. For whatever reason, many modern action films are using shaky cam. Instead of clear, steady shots, the DP will go hand held, and shake the camera violently. The worst example in recent memory of this is, Taken 3. Thankfully, there are films like this, and others, that know exactly how to do a good action scene. Director Tim Miller and cinematographer Ken Seng do a brilliant job creating slick, good looking action. Not only is the action brutal, and extremely bloody, it\'s just co clear and well handled. The fights are really great here. I couldn\'t help but be reminded of Tarantino\'s, Kill Bill films while watching Deadpool. They are incredibly similar in their style of fight scenes.\n\nSitting in the cinema, the inner critic in me struggled internally. I kept thinking afterwards about the film. What were the flaws? I don\'t often see a film without pointing out the negatives. Even films I really like, or even love, have flaws. I\'m certain that if one sits and picks this apart, you will eventually find some flaws. Perhaps the overall story is paper thin. Perhaps the villain wasn\'t very compelling as character. Then again, Ajax was honestly serviceable. Ed Skrein gave a great performance, and by the end, you really hate the bastard. He\'s a generic, or a dick, British villain and the film makes fun of that!\n\n\"Deadpool\" and Guardians of the Galaxy were both huge risks that ultimately paid off, big time. As a film, it\'s nearly perfect. The film does exactly what it needed to do, and more. It introduces Deadpool, sets up his character, and gets you to like him if you didn\'t already. The non linear narrative was refreshing to see in a superhero film. Everything about this film was different and unique. It\'s self awareness and breaking of the fourth wall work well; really well.

Little credit should be given to 20th Century Fox, as they had zero faith in the success of a Deadpool movie. To put things into perspective, Ryan Reynolds fought for this film back in 2004 when Blade: Trinity was released. Reynolds and co. went to shoot test footage that was then leaked online by Reynolds because Fox had no intentions to release it to the public. Finally, after years and years of BEGGING to the studio and the overwhelming positive responses of the test footage from the public, Fox didn\'t even tell Reynolds and co. that the film was greenlit. They had to find out online like the rest of us plebeians. If that sounds bad, Fox even cut their budget by $7 million AT THE LAST MINUTE, which caused the writers to scratch some action sequences that I\'m sure would\'ve been great to see.\n\nDeadpool now has the biggest opening weekend in the month of February (surpassing Fifty Shades of Grey), the biggest opening weekend for 20th Century Fox (surpassing all the X-Men films), and the biggest opening weekend for an R rated film EVER (surpassing The Matrix: Reloaded). With all that being said, Deadpool is a hilariously entertaining film that works mainly because of Reynolds himself. His comedic skills pay off gloriously as the titular character, who gives so many quips in one instance that some jokes will be missed. Of course, credit should be given to the writers too (AKA: The Real Heroes Here), and it\'s impressive that this is Tim Miller\'s directorial debut. The action sequences and pacing are so good that you\'d think this came from a veteran director.\n\nFrom the ingenious opening credits to the subversive ending, Deadpool constantly upends clichés and tropes you\'re used to seeing in superhero flicks in the past few years. What\'s great here is the filmmakers had something weird and perverse and just went with it. Jokes about pedophilia, pegging, and sex run rampant, but it\'s never really dark, despite the mature subject matter. On top of that, it\'s also very refreshing to see a pansexual superhero in such a big studio film. It\'s unheard of these days. Fox and other studios, learn from this success. It\'s not the fact that a hard R-rated film can do well, it\'s that Deadpool also happens to be very good, most likely because you, Fox, actually gave the filmmakers the creative freedom to do whatever the hell they wanted.'),(869,51,'7/10','I am NOT the target audience for this one...please keep this in mind as you read.','planktonrules','16 July 2017','I am a 53 year-old man...and the target audience for \"Deadpool\" is much, much younger.

In typical superhero films the characters are stiff and super serious, in Deadpool the characters are filled with personality and can range from the serious Francis to the silly Deadpool giving this a parody like feel, in a good way.\n\nAlso what is different is that this is a story of revenge rather then saving the city/world/universe that is seen in every single superhero film. Also the tone of film is more comic then dark thanks to the fantastic humor of all kinds from slapstick to dirty to just plain silly, this film just does not stop the laughs (I laughed 20- 30 times in my SECOND watch).\n\nAs for being an origin story, I can say that the backstory placements were well done, equally as funny, and explains only what is important in understanding the story.

Deadpool in this film is very much himself, and there\'s plenty of R-rated humor the usual PG-13 Marvel film tries to avoid, but in the end, the film gets bogged down by a typical 3rd act finale (the weakest point of the film), another forgettable Marvel villain in Ajax (possibly the worst),plus the typical supporting characters like the love interest and goofy sidekick. It\'s all a little too conventional for such an unconventional character in Deadpool, and the movie suffers.\n31 out of 58 found this helpful. Was this review helpful?

But this movie is a comedy, where its main protagonist, Deadpool, should be perceived as a comedian, and Ryan Reynolds did an excellent job representing this character.\n\nThe story of Deadpool isn\'t complex or profound - and it wasn\'t meant to be. This movie is all about fun and entertainment, abundant with action, jokes, blood and foul language. Therefore, it is not suitable for children. I grew tired of people thinking that movies based on comics are intended for children only.\n\nRelated to that, I believe that many Marvel movies could have been far more successful if they didn\'t refrain from gory scenes. I am sorry, but if you want to make a serious combat-based movie and you make it without blood, than that movie will be all but serious.\n\nThat is why I see Deadpool as a refreshment. Nowadays many writers and directors are too worried about political correctness in their movies. That really stifles creativity and that is why today we have so many movies with great ideas but poor realization.\n\nThus, to me, Deadpool was a very pleasant surprise, I had fun watching it, and I intend to watch it again some time soon.'),(873,51,'6/10','It is a good 6.5 or 7 movie, but 8+ is overrated','movie_goer82','29 March 2016','Just watched it and would say it is a bit overrated.

I can see why it\'s overly hyped and the parody-like humour was intense and far fetched. Although I enjoyed the humour, I found it pretty silly and unconvincing for mostly being filled with sex scenes and nudity, foul language or sexual puns, sarcasm and blood. I couldn\'t really take the film seriously.\n\nI also got the sense that the screenplay tried to break \"stereotypes\" with men and women and whom is more acceptable to \"hit\" in a fight. Also, the mutant girl seemed boyish and mean, while Colossal was sensitive and polite. Plot was strange and never had a glimpse of how Deadpool\'s girlfriend was coping with his sudden disappearance. Character development was quite poor overall. It was difficult to focus on the story since the humour and gory torture scenes were the main atmosphere. There were no triggers or signs of mental trauma after being abused, but I still appreciated Deadpool\'s happy persona and his fight against cancer.\n\nI was also quite shocked at the nudity scenes and even seeing Stan Lee appearing as a cameo in a strip club with naked women. I don\'t think this is true to Marvel\'s legacy and the meaning behind their superhero/villain movies. Yet, it appealed to a certain audience and I guess it was a \"money-maker/parody/Let\'s shock audiences\" type of film rather than being focused on Deadpool\'s character. They even had to create a short origin story halfway through the movie to reframe the storyline and basically says \"Oops. There, there, ya happy now?\" Talk about being distracted.\n\nI normally enjoy Ryan\'s movies, but it\'s almost as if Ryan Reynolds himself directed and wrote the entire script. Nothing serious and characters had nothing to hold on or relate to. Deadpool had a greater chance for more creativity and depth, but the \"fast entertainment\" was the only potential. I still enjoyed the film and also because I love the X-Men franchise.

This films tries very hard to be edgy and raunchy, as well as claiming to not be your average Marvel film because of those following reasons. But let me assure you; This film is most definitely very similar to all of the other Marvel films. By saying \"fuck\" a few times, showing breasts at a strip club and throwing childish insults such as \"dicktits\" is not smart filmmaking or screen writing. It is easy adolescent humor. This film has a simple plot that is easy to follow and is spoonfed to you.

There have been a lot of visually stunning works but nobody cared about the hero. (Or nobody simply cared about anything.) There a few, though, which aroused interest and intellect but nobody \'ooh\'-ed or \'aah\'-ed at the special effects. With The Matrix, both elements are perfectly en sync. Not only did we want to cheer on the heroes to victory, we wanted them to bludgeon the opposition. Not only did we sit in awe as Neo evaded those bullets in limbo-rock fashion, we salivated.\n\nBut what makes The Matrix several cuts above the rest of the films in its genre is that there are simply no loopholes. The script, written by the Wachowski brothers is intelligent but carefully not geeky. The kung-fu sequences were deftly shot -- something even Bruce Lee would\'ve been proud of. The photography was breathtaking. (I bet if you had to cut every frame on the reel and had it developed and printed, every single frame would stand on its own.) And the acting? Maybe not the best Keanu Reeves but name me an actor who has box-office appeal but could portray the uneasy and vulnerable protagonist, Neo, to a T the way Reeves did. But, come to think of it, if you pit any actor beside Laurence Fishburne, you\'re bound to confuse that actor for bad acting. As Morpheus, Mr. Fishburne is simply wicked! Shades of his mentor-role in Higher Learning, nobody exudes that aura of quiet intensity than Mr. Fishburne. His character, battle-scarred but always composed Morpheus, is given an extra dose of mortality (He loves Neo to a fault.) only Mr. Fishburne can flesh out.\n\nPeople will say what they want to say about how good The Matrix is but the bottomline is this: finally there\'s a philosophical film that has cut through this generation. My generation. The Wachowski brothers probably scribbled a little P.S. note when they finished the script saying: THINK FOR A MOMENT ABOUT YOUR EXISTENCE. What is the Matrix, you ask? Something that\'s closer to reality than you think.\n\nEither that or it\'s my personal choice for best film of all-time.'),(887,52,'0U','One of the best action sci fi action movies of all time!','23 February 2020','Was this review helpful?

To tell the truth the first time I saw the film I was enamored by the effects. I remember thinking to myself that this was one of the most visually stunning films I had ever seen in my life. Also having always been a comic book fan and a fan of films that were larger than life, the transitional element of the story was very appealing to me and this probably heightened my enjoyment of the film very much. It wasn\'t until some time later (and after having seen the film a few times more) that I started to think about the film. I recognized the Christian elements quite quickly but it wasn\'t until I wrote an actual 15-page essay on the film that I tapped into some of the philosophical and religious elements and that made me appreciate the film even more. I won\'t say that I have recognized all elements because the film is quite literally packed with them.\n\nActing wise the film works excellently. I won\'t say that there aren\'t any issues because there are but overall the acting is pretty flawless. Keanu Reeves plays the main character, Neo, or Thomas A. Anderson and while he is not the perfect actor I think he does a pretty good job in The Matrix (and the sequels). He doesn\'t have the longest of lines which was probably a deliberate choice from the directors and it works because this gives him a better opportunity to work on posture and facial expressions and I must say that overall his body language is very good. Very clear and well defined. Laurence Fishbourne plays Neo\'s mentor Morpheus and he does an excellent job of it. His lines flow with a certain confidence and style that makes his character somewhat unique and interesting. Carrie-Anne Moss does a good job as well and succeeds in looking both cool and sexy in her leather outfit. Joe Pantoliano, a critically underrated actor does a brilliant job of bringing his character, Cypher, to life. I can\'t say much about him because his character is pretty essential to the plot and I certainly don\'t wan\'t to spoil it for anyone. Gloria Foster appears in a relatively small role that will have greater significance in the following films and she does a very good job. The best acting is provided by Hugo Weaving, however, in his portrayal of Agent Smith. It is really something to watch him act out the changes in his character. Agent Smith gains some human traits like anger, sense of dread, hate and eventually even a sly sense of humor (mostly in the sequels). Two thumbs way up to Weaving who has created one of the finest screen villains of all time.\n\nEffects wise the film is simply stunning and it deservedly was awarded the Oscar for best effects (and was regrettably cheated out of a nomination in the Best Film category) ahead of even Star Wars. The reason that I think The Matrix deserves the Oscar for best effects is simply that the effects in The Matrix are more innovative than the ones in Star Wars. Just take a look at how many times the effects have been spoofed and you\'ll probably agree. The effects also help in the symbolism of the film and in creating a very dystopian atmosphere not unlike the one seen in Blade Runner and this works brilliantly. The film looks beautiful at all times and today 6 years later (my God has it already been 6 years?) the effects still hold their ground against new science fiction films. Add the effects to the brilliant editing and you have a visual masterpiece on your hands. Very well done.\n\nThe reason that I think The Matrix is more reviewable than pretty much any other film is the story and the philosophical and religious elements of the story because with every viewing I catch something I didn\'t see the previous time I watched it. Without spoiling the film I think I can mention a few of the more obvious elements. Obviously the film draws on the Messiah myth as Neo is a clear reference to Jesus with the analogy of his name (Neo = one, as in The One) but also hidden in his other name, Thomas A. Anderson. The first part of his last name, Anderson comes from the Greek Andros meaning \"man\" and combine this with the second part of his last name \"son\" and add a little creativity you will come up with the combination \"son of man\" which was a title Jesus came up with about himself. Also the first time we meet Neo a man calls him (and I quote): \"You\'re my Saviour man. My own personal Jesus Christ.\" It doesn\'t get any more obvious than that. Aside from the Christianic elements the film also gets its inspiration from Budhism, Gnosticism (Gnosis = knowledge) but is also inspired by Plato and his analogy of the Cave and Jean Baudrillard\'s essay, Simulacra and Simulations. Explaining these elements would make this review go on forever so aside from mentioning them I will not comment on them further.\n\nTo all the people who doubt the profound nature of The Matrix I can only give one advice: Free your mind and watch the film again. You won\'t regret it. If I had to choose a favorite all time film my choice would probably fall on either The Matrix (obviously I don\'t expect people to agree but if they do thats great) or The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King and I recommend it to all fans of sci-fi and people who like philosophy.\n\n10/10 - on my top 3 of best films.'),(889,52,'10/10','Welcome to the Real World.','notoriousCASK','11 April 2018','Without a doubt one of the best and most influential movies of all time, the Matrix is the defining science fiction film of the 1990\'s and the biggest leap the genre has taken since Stanley Kubrick\'s 2001: A Space Odyssey and Ridley Scott\'s Blade Runner. The Matrix is a ground-breaking motion picture that not only raised the bar for all the science-fiction films to come after it but also redefined the action genre with its thrilling action sequences and revolutionary visual effects.\n\nThe film tells the story of Thomas Anderson a computer hacker that in the world of hacking goes by the alias of Neo. When he is contacted by the mysterious outlaw Morpheus and having always questioned his reality, he is awakened to the truth that the world he\'s been living in is a simulated reality called the Matrix and that he\'s nothing more than a slave in this dystopian world, created and controlled by A.I powered machines.\n\nThe direction and script by the Wachowskis is fantastic, as they drew ideas and inspirations from every other great sci-fi and cyberpunk movie and anime before the film, combining it with stunning action and putting it into one picture that has enough style, substance and subtext that everyone ended up giving their own interpretation of the story. The research that went into the preparation of the screenplay is quite extensive but the manner in which it is presented on the big screen is also very impressive. Every character presented on the film, has a well-defined arc and a purpose, and their motivations are clear.\n\nThe cinematography is impeccable. It was very innovative in the use of the camera angles and movements, the zooms, the slow-motion captures and the different color palette used to differentiate the Matrix and the real World. The editing is flawless, as it makes sure that every scene is integral to the story and ensures the pace of the film stays ferocious through its entire runtime. Each frame is also packed with so much visual information for the viewer to devour. The visual effects introduced us to the bullet-time effect and their impact can still be felt in today\'s movies. The performances are also incredible. Each member of the cast gave their best performances and brought the characters they portray to life, but the one that stands out the most is Hugo Weaving\'s disciplined rendition of his character, Agent Smith; a powerful computer program made to search and destroy the human rebellion, in undoubtedly the greatest performance in his career.\n\nIn conclusion The Matrix is a masterpiece everyone should see. It is one of the most thought provoking, inventive, pioneering, influential and stylish movies of all time and it\'s also full of philosophical and religious allegories waiting for interpretation. Immortal for its contribution to cinema and pop culture, its brilliant combination of inventive visual effects, excellent vision and exquisite action easily makes it one of the best, most influential and most entertaining movies ever made.'),(890,52,'9/10','One of my favorites','Xophianic','2 February 2000','At first, I wasn\'t interested in seeing the Matrix.

Spoiler: It\'s still brilliant.','david-meldrum','22 February 2019','20 years after its release, and several years since I last saw it, some reflections on the experience of rewatching The Matrix. In no particular order ...\n\n1) It still look great. I mean, this is one amazing, stylish looking phone. Very little about the look of the film has dated - the mobile phones, obviously, Neo\'s computer, and very briefly a couple of visual effects creak. But otherwise, this looks as amazing at it did on release. It\'s sumptuous.\n\n2) I think I was one of the many who misjudged Keanu Reeves all those yeas ago. I made easy jokes about his vacant stare and apparent intelligent. From this vantage point we can see he\'s been in a good number of successful, intelligent films. It\'s also become clear that within the industry he as a reputation as decent, hardworking man who is a pleasure to work with.\n\n3) It\'s apparent again how literate and cine-literate the film is. I knew this 20 years ago, but since then I\'ve seen a lot more films and read a lot more books, and this time around I especially loved the way the film nods its head to other film genres and influences. I noticed a lot of Peckinpah, and did I see a nod to Kurosawa there too? And I was reminded that for an English Literature graduate like me, this is a goldmine of quotes, allusions and references.\n\n4) Seen 20 years on, its influence on cinema since is clear. There\'s a lot we could talk about here, but I was especially struck by how indebted a director like Christopher Nolan is (keeper of the flame of intelligent blockbusters), especially with Inception.\n\n5) I\'d forgotten that the narrative ostensibly maintains uncertainty about Neo\'s identity until just before the end. I\'m not sure this really works - anyone who\'s read many books or ever done an anagram will not find that the most suspenseful part of the narrative.\n\n6) Despite a run time of 2 and a quarter hours, it never flags and attention never wonders. The film fizzes with kinetic energy and the time flies by. It\'s a lean film, without a wasted moment.\n\n7) The film is, of course, packed with religious allusions. When I wrote a chapter on this for my BA Theology dissertation, I said I thought the film was neo-Bhuddist (forgive the pun, please), and I stand by that on rewatching. Of course, there\'s lots of allusions to Christian and other theology, and The Matrix spawned some really bad reading of film by Christians which has never really stopped. When will some Christians learn to read a film/book etc with integrity and understanding of what the film is trying to do? It\'s a spiritually confused mish-mash of a film - but still a gloriously entertaining one.\n\n8) All these years later, it turns out The Matrix was somewhat prophetic about the role technology would play in our lives. Humans permanently plugged in to networks? Different layers of reality that are somehow more real than what we think of as real? The Wachowskis saw all that and more coming 20 years ago. Artists are the weather vane of society; we really should learn to pay attention to them.\n\n9) Bottom line. I still bloody love this film. I\'m trying to work out if I have the requisite strength to revisit the sequels....'),(897,52,'10/10','The more you watch it, the better it gets','emptyskies','23 April 2002','The Wachowski brothers really did excel themselves with this movie. It\'s a brilliant movie on a number of different levels - the directing is excellent, the camera work is great, the visuals are stunning, the kung-fu is A+, acting is executed with style and conviction, and the plot is truly inspired. It\'s really hard to use enough superlatives on this movie!\n\nIt\'d be a 10/10, except for the ending. Having Neo do what he does at the end really lets it down, in my opinion. However, there\'s a couple of sequels on the way, so let\'s see what the Wachowskis can do to make up for it.\n\nOther than that, (and like I said above) the movie is operating on so many different levels that each time you watch it, you pick up something new... this isn\'t by accident, either. The Wachowski brothers had the actors read a number of definitive works (Simulation & Simulcra was one I believe) in modern literature and psychology, and applied liberal dashings of aspects of the major religions to provide the best sci-fi movie of the decade, if not ever.\n\nI\'m yet to meet somebody who hasn\'t enjoyed it.

The Matrix along with They Live have the best metaphors about life/society, most of which a lot of the population aren\'t woke to!\n\nFor example the entire speech Morpheus says \"The Matrix is everywhere. It is all around us. Even now, in this very room. You can see it when you look out your window or when you turn on your television. You can feel it when you go to work... when you go to church... when you pay your taxes. It is the world that has been pulled over your eyes to blind you from the truth. That you are a slave, Like everyone else you were born into bondage. Into a prison that you cannot taste or see or touch. A prison for your mind.\" Among other brilliant quotes like when he talks about what the world has become, then mentions we have become this referring to a battery. So many genius lines I could list that I won\'t.\n\nThe effects, stunts, lighting, sounds, and tone are outstandingly spot on! They really did train for the fight sequences for months I\'ve seen all the special features plus more. Yes this is a sci-fi film, but I see it as a documentary as well. We\'re all slaves that take the blue pill throughout many things it\'s just hard to realize that. I also love what someone else said, it\'s a benchmark for sci-fi to come, that is very true and it\'s the last of its kind; movies aren\'t made like this anymore!\n\nA lot of people worked hard to make this film what it is.

This ended up not being that huge a problem for me because everything else is so well executed.\n\nParticularly striking about \'The Matrix\' is its production values. Simply put, the film looks amazing in its audacious production design, dazzling special effects that are some of the most ultra-cool and imaginative to exist, super slick editing and often jaw dropping cinematography. So much more than a film with ground-breaking special effects and use of camera work that broke boundaries.\n\nUse of sound was also striking, and how the pulsating and hypnotic music score was used. Andy and Larry Wachowski direct adeptly, while the script is an intelligent mix of complex and well-explored themes, mysticism, philosophy and even Lewis Carroll and the story is often invigorating and intensely taut with a smart concept brilliantly done.\n\nAction is superbly shot and edited, and the way it is choreographed is relentlessly intense and breathless in its energy, Kung Fu has rarely been more vertigo-inducing (despite how this sounds, this is not a bad thing as it added hugely to the intensity and paranoia of the story\'s atmosphere) on film.\n\nKeanu Reeves is in one of his best and most iconic roles and has never looked cooler, certainly has not looked this comfortable for a while before then. Carrie Anne Moss is strong. Even better are an imposingly charismatic Laurence Fishburne (also in one of his best roles), an amusing Joe Pantoliano and a deliciously wicked Hugo Weaving.\n\nSumming up, not one of the best of the genre but a mile-stone nonetheless and a great one.

It has philosophical and literary pretensions that come off as kindergarten philosophy at best and ham-handed at worst. Luckily, these can be ignored fairly easily.\n\nGood action sequences for the most part. Most of the cast is summer-movie capable. i.e. Their acting is neither embarrassing nor impressive. Keanu gives his second-best performance ever (after Bill and Ted\'s Excellent Adventure). Unfortunately, that is likely merely the convergence of his naturally confused look with the confusion inherent to the character.\n\nAll things considered a fun action movie provided you don\'t buy the hype telling you that it is so much more.\n\nBy the way, stop with this one. This movie is watchable and complete in its own and is only degraded by its truly dreadful sequels.

It managed to hang in there throughout, though the ending was too formulaic. In addition, the voice-over at the very end reminded me of the final scene in Saving Private Ryan. It almost ruins a fantastic film.\n\nThe only other objection I can come up with is that the you must know, you must be type philosophy being handed out was just a tad hokey. I must pleasantly admit though, since I don\'t get to admit this very often, that The Matrix is worth seeing despite these things.\n\nThe visuals are extremely impressive, particularly the \"white room,\" the baby harvester, the training scene with the \"red woman,\" the Reeves interrogation scene... I have to agree with some of the previous comments that the plot idea won\'t seem overly original to a fan of Philip K Dick, but then what is original after you\'ve read him? The Matrix has more original things to say than two months worth of standard Hollywood fare. I have a great deal of respect for a film which will have someone say \"they\'re turning humans into this\" and hold up a battery. A plot which looks at man as machine will get a thumbs up from me just for trying.\n\nI feel some hope for the future of movie-making in America to be able to recommend this film.'),(902,53,'10/10','They said you were a giant. They said you can crush a man\'s skull with one hand.','hitchcockthelegend','6 August 2014','Ridley Scott\'s Gladiator is not a perfect film, I would think that the hardiest of fans, of which I\'m firmly one, know this deep down. Yet just like Commodus in the film is keen to point out that he himself has other virtues that are worthy, so does Gladiator the film. Enough in fact to make it an everlasting favourite of genre fans and worthy of the Academy Award acknowledgements it received.\n\nIn narrative terms the plot and story arc is simplicity supreme, something Scott and Russell Crowe have never shied away from. There has to my knowledge as well, never been a denial of the debt Gladiator owes to Anthony Mann\'s 1964 Epic, The Fall of the Roman Empire. Some folk seem very irritated by this, which is strange because the makers of Gladiator were not standing up bold as brass to proclaim they were unique with their movie, what they did do was reinvigorate a stagnant genre of film for a new generational audience. And it bloody worked, the influence and interest in all things Roman or historically swashbuckling of film that followed post Gladiator\'s success is there for all to see.\n\nWhat we do in life echoes in eternity.\n\nSo no originality in story, then. While some of the CGI is hardly \"Grade A\" stuff, and there\'s a little over - mugging acting in support ranks as some of the cast struggle to grasp the period setting required, yet the way Gladiator can make the emotionally committed feel - overrides film making irks. Crowe\'s Maximus is the man men want to be and the man women want to be with. As he runs through the gamut of life\'s pains and emotionally fortified trials and tribulations, we are with him every step of the way, urging him towards his day of revenge splattered destiny; with Crowe superb in every pained frame, winning the Academy Award for Best Actor that he should have won for The Insider the previous year.\n\nBacking Crowe up is Joaquin Phoenix giving Commodus preening villainy and Connie Nielsen graceful as Lucilla (pitch Nielsen\'s turn here against that of Diane Kruger\'s in Troy to see the class difference for historical period playing). Oliver Reed, leaving the mortal coil but leaving behind a spicy two fold performance as Proximo the Gladiator task master. Olly superb in both body and CGI soul. Richard Harris tugging the heart strings, Derek Jacobi classy, David Hemmings also, while Djimon Hounso gives Juba - Maximus right hand man and confidante - a level of character gravitas that\'s inspiring.\n\nI didn\'t know man could build such things.\n\nDialogue is literate and poetic, resplendent with iconic speeches. Action is never far away, but never at the expense of wrought human characterisations. The flaming arrows and blood letting of the Germania conflict kicks things off with pulse raising clarity, and Scott and his team never sag from this standard. The gladiator arena fights are edge of the seat inducing, the recreation for the Battle of Carthage a stunning piece of action sequence construction. And then the finale, the culmination of two men\'s destinies, no soft soaping from Scott and Crowe, it lands in the heart with a resounding thunderclap. A great swords and sandals movie that tipped its helmet to past masters whilst simultaneously bringing the genre alive again.

Russell Crowe is brilliant in his role as Maximus, the \"general who became a slave, who became a gladiator, who defied an emperor.\" Crowe\'s intense style is perfect for the relentless determination and confidence of Maximus. Joaquin Phoenix is equally wonderful in his role as Commodus, the corrupt emperor.

It also helps that Joaquin has the classic Caesar look that works perfectly with his role.\n\nConnie Nielsen is also very good as Lucilla. However, perhaps the two finest performances in the movie were given by a couple of acting veterans in supporting roles. Richard Harris and Oliver Reed were exceptional in what will be remembered as crowning achievements at the end of their careers. Harris was perfect as Marcus Aurelius, the aging Caesar who reflects upon his life and contemplates how the world will remember him.

Saved from death by slavers, he is purchased for use as a gladiator by Proximo (Reed) and ends up in the arena of all arena\'s, the Colloseum, where he proves unbeatable under his guise as \"The Spaniard\".\n\nAnd with a budget of over $100m, Scott certainly delivers the goods. GLADIATOR transcends the notion of \'blockbuster\' that we have become accustomed to in the age of electronic and special effects wizardry and instead offers a good old fashioned action film along the lines of Spartacus and and Ben Hur. Not only are we drawn into an archetypal story that contains all the classic elements a filmgoer could dream of (love, loss, courage, despair, good triumphing over evil etc etc) - also on offer is a visual feast of cinematic painting after painting - a rich tapestry of images that are breathtaking and ultimately visually satisfying. From the plains of Germania, to the desert stronghold of Zuchobar, and finally to great Rome herself, John Mathiesion, the cinematographer is to be commended highly for his general inventiveness and ability to capture so much on film. The opening battle scene is superb as a cast of thousands erupt across the screen and provide an indication that we are about to see a film that pays incredible attention to detail throughout its entirety. In every way, Scott has created a world for us that scuttles films of similar epic undertakings (and budgets!) and sends them to their dooms at the bottom of the murky depths of film history where they belong.\n\nThe cast is generally very strong. Crowe proves himself very suitable to the task with a great emotional range and depth of character. His accent ocassionally bugged me (as did the mish mash of accents on offer - but that is I guess a legacy of \'internationally casted films\'), but this aside, he was well and truly up to the task. Phoenix is also excellent as the disturbed Commodus, as is Nielson as Lucilla, the daughter of Marcus who \"should have been a son\" and finds herself torn between loyalty to her brother and doing what is \'right\'. The old guard thesps of Harris, Reed and Jacobi (Grachus) are uniformly strong as supporting characters, and Spencer Treat Clark (Lucius) does a fine job as the young heir to the throne.\n\nAdd to this great cast excellent editing and post production work, and an intricate soundscape (including a magnificent Hans Zimmer score), and you have a film that, despite its length, was highly palatable and had me in there from beginning to end. A must see.'),(919,53,'7/10','Adequate Roman Epic','cutter-12','29 March 2002','There is much to appreciate about about this picture but at the same time there is much to castigate as well. What could have been a thoroughly involving story turns out to be crippled by a lean script, some very indecisive direction and choppy editing. Not to mention some bad casting in the form of Richard Harris as Marcus Aurelius, a role which cries out to have been the last role played by Anthony Quinn.\n\nThe film starts out well and looks bleakly authentic in its depiction of the pivotal battle in the wars between the barbarian tribes of Germania and the Roman Empire. But as the story gives way to 40 minutes of exposition following Commodus and Lucilla\'s introduction, Ridley Scott seems to tack things on whenever the script runs into weak spots. This leaves the film without a flowing narrative and it seems to want to please a mindless summer movie action market while at the same time aspiring to be something deeper. What it leaves us with is a schizophrenic, unequivocal story full of contradictions.\n\nThere seems to be an epidemic in the past three or four years - films like this, Titanic, The Patriot, Pearl Harbor, Enemy at the Gates etc, try hard to be great epic films but at their core they are very slight and even trivial. The story in Gladiator holds promise but what little conflict there is set up and thrown at us in the first hour, leaving just a linear resolution to unfold for the remainder. A shame because so many elements could have been introduced in this story to make it truly an awesome and thoughtful epic. I guess complex stories like Spartacus and Ben-Hur will never be made again. This one falls somewhere short, though better than Demitrius and the Gladiators and the film it heavily borrows its narrative structure from - The fall of the Roman Empire.\n\nTechnically the CGI is at times seamless and other times poor. When our troop of Gladiators run into the colosseum for the first time however the effect is absolutely jaw dropping and the scene that follows certainly delivers the action goods. The acting is very good throughout except for Tomas Arana as Quintus (about as bad as John Dall in Spartacus) and the aforementioned Richard Harris.\n\nLike Braveheart, not a bad entertainment experience but highly Hollywoodized and with an uneven narrative. But unlike Braveheart, the ending to Gladiator is a just a little embarrassing as it rips off both Braveheart and Titanic to far less effect. If you can get past the flaws, not the worst Roman spectacle on offer. Too highly rated at 8.1/10.'),(920,53,'10/10','Today I saw a movie become more powerful . . .','wideawakedreamer','4 June 2000','The movie is the story of Maximus (Crowe), a general who leads the Roman army to victory over Germania in the beginning of the movie. The dying emperor of Rome, Marcus Aurelius, is watching this battle.\n\nThe emperor\'s son, Commodus, then arrives with his sister Lucilla, and it is discovered that Commodus fully expects to be announced the new emperor of Rome in a few days. Aurelius, however, has other plans--he wants to make Maximus emperor, and requests that of the general, who wants nothing more than to go home to his family.\n\nI went into this movie having just watched Ben-Hur in my film studies class and having watched an episode of Xena only a couple of weeks earlier that featured the story of Marc Anthony and Cleopatra. So you could say I was in the perfect mindset to watch a \"sword-and-sandal\" movie. I wasn\'t sure what to expect, having somehow avoided all the hype that accompanied this movie. But I was not disappointed.\n\nGladiator features some wonderful cinematography by John Mathieson. The battle scenes are very graphic. (This movie is not for the squeamish, that\'s for sure.) There were some scenes in particular that really struck me, such as when Crowe appears to be floating over the ground very fast. The use of color and color tones added a great deal to the mood of the movie. Excellent.\n\nThe script was being written and re-written as the filming was going on, yet it doesn\'t show that the actors had no idea how the movie was going to end when they began filming. The acting is terrific. Russell Crowe is wonderfully cast as Maximus. Many reviewers agree that he is now officially a star. Joaquin Phoenix also proves his mettle as the emotionally troubled Commodus, whose behavior and emotion toward his sister could give anyone the creeps. Connie Nielsen makes you believe that, as Lucilla, she really is torn between natural loyalty to her brother and doing what she knows is right. Oliver Reed, in his last performance, is memorable in his role of Proximo, the former gladiator who is the owner of Maximus and brings him to Rome. In short, the actors were brilliant in their roles, not over-acting, but giving subtle, strong performances.\n\nThe script itself is very good. Although some elements are a little hard to believe--the fact that no one recognizes Maximus when he\'s a slave?--this film calls for a willing suspension of disbelief, which one would happily comply with. (It\'s really no fun to nitpick such a movie.)\n\nIt\'s true that this movie does pretty much follow the Braveheart formula. However, this movie includes some elements, such as the cinematography and the incredibly graphic battle scenes (one reviewer likened it to Saving Private Ryan, \"only better\"), that are spectacular in itself. Overall, a great movie that I highly recommend.'),(921,53,'7/10','Nice movie but is this original','quirinus','11 October 2005','Movie is technically very fine i have watched in theater twice and i like it much as lots of turks but sometime after the reason why we loved this movie became clear this was only a western look over an old Turkish movie series Tarkan...

A year later, Becky has given up climbing and become an alcoholic shut-in. She has estranged herself from her father, James (Jeffrey Dean Morgan) , because he suggested that Dan was not the right man for her. Decide to climb an old communications tower 600 meters high as a way to fight against the partner of one of them, who died while the three of them were climbing together. However, m as soon as they reach the top, the steps fall and they are trapped in this remote and precarious metal structure. Fear reaches new heights !. Dropping soon !.\n\nThe film contains thrills, chills, suspense, terror, spectacular aerial frames, and plot twists too. Scott Mann directs this fast-paced thriller in which two rock climbing lovers , the two experienced climbers: the two lead actresses Grace Caroline Currey, Virginia Gardner did the bulk of their own stunts- embark on a high-risk adventure to the top of the abandoned B67 TV tower . This takes place almost entirely in the towers, where both young women will have to survive on a platform of very few meters from the inclement weather and the dangers of the night.\n\nIt contains a thrilling and suspenseful musical score by Tim Despic . As well as atmospherically adequate cinematography by MacGregor, shot on location in Shadow Mountains, Mojave Desert, California, Four Aces Movie Ranch, Palmdale, Lancaster, California. This decently produced motion picture was well directed by Scott Mann. Scott Mann detailed how it was shot: filmëd on location with the actresses using support wires, the whole thing is real. It\'s the real structure, they\'re really up there, and more than anything, the elements that beat them, the whipping around and everything, they\'re all very real We had these IMAX-sized cameras, went up and basically found the top tip of a mountain that had this big dropoff. And then we built the tower sections by the mountain and that enabled us to film pretty much everything for real with the girls on top of the tower and then if you ever looked right down, there was an element where we had to stitch in ground that we shot elsewhere in the desert to feel it¨. Scott Mann\'s an action expert directing some succesful films with plenty of spectacular set pieces , violence , thrills and twisted intrigues , such as : ¨The Tournament¨, ¨Heist¨, ¨Down Amongst the Dead¨ , ¨Final Score¨ and ¨Fall¨.

Fortunately, Fall is not one of those films, doing very well to handle the entire ordeal in rough 84 minutes. The pacing is decent, finding good ways to utilize the moment to get character development while also keeping the suspenseful element strong. It\'s a nice mixture of the two elements and helps bring at least decent representation of both thrills and drama spills.\n\nGreat Musical Score: This movie is one of those where music really makes a difference at those key elements. Fall may not have the biggest or most unique track list, but it utilizes the limited song title quite well to really add the finesse and inspiration these scores do. Cherry Pie as a casual rock out moment and then as an inspiration cheer was quite fun and a good connecting point. While orchestral scores make up those killer finishing shots that are amazing across the board. There is not much I can say pass this, but perhaps Fall will at least make you want to listen to the 80s song again.\n\nMessage Is Powerful: So many movies these days are about delivering that gigantic message to hopefully inspire the \"change\" that we all \"need.\" Fall has a couple of deep messages that do well to display some important topics, and most of them are pretty good. There is some trauma, no surprise right as these movies go, and how to handle these moments or at least the mindset some face, is decently glimpses in this film. Other moments like facing the fears, the will to survive, and pushing yourself are very big in this film, and there is surprising wisdom and class in the dialogue and filming to really show this message. It\'s target audience in particular should be inspired the most and find the words in particular worthy of being on your social media quotes.\n\nActing Is Good: This movie heavily focuses on two characters and the actresses are the ones to hold much of the attention of the film. Let\'s get this out of the way, they are very attractive, one the bosom blonde with that fiery energy, the other one delicate gorgeous and sensitive. With those superficial components out of the way, the girls are very good at displaying the qualities you need for this very focused movie. Morgan, for what little he is in it, does well with his time, and manages to deliver his few lines with fantastic abilities. Gardner is vibrant and playing the typical thriller type woman you see in these films. She\'s bold, she brings the one liners and meme looks that modern generations love, and of course representing the new generation of humans. She\'s bold, she talks a lot, and yet has some deeper layers that come out as the film progresses to help break the superficial mirror a bit. Yet it\'s Currey who claims my vote for best acting. As Becky, she really brings so many qualities that I grasped onto, her story deeper, more developed, and more realistic to help round out the character. Most of her acting is solid and sincere, and was the character that annoyed me the least with the direction that they took. Well done!\n\nThe Makeup: You can guess that trouble does eventually ensue if you have seen the trailers, which means the potential to suffer from the consequences. Fall is all about making the suffering look real, the make-up and effects solid as the girls gradually look dehydrated, exhausted and exposed to the element. It adds that suspense and experience effect, really selling to me just how miserable something like this would be if it happened. And when other things happen, they pull out some impressive tricks to make it believable.\n\nGreat Presentation: I can\'t say much about this, but let\'s just say that this presentation was solid for telling the story they wanted. Fall does a great job of laying out the story, and plotting out gradual transition of this journey, bringing things into a gradual build up to again help keep that attempt at suspense going. It is mostly very natural, and the editing solid to deliver so much in such a short amount of time. And when the climax hits, all the effects come together to finish the thrill ride in that last drop.\n\nThe Cinematography: My favorite part of the whole movie, the cinematography is key to what makes this movie the spectacle it is. This film really pulled a lot of tricks to make the tower look as foreboding as it should be. MacGregor finds all the right angle to get the scene going, from upward shots of the tower, to the angles looking down the valley below to establish the magnitude of the climb. Then he takes it one step further finding the perfect shot to continue showing everything the girls are experiencing including: close ups of them really struggling, the dynamic angle changes as they dangle from ropes and the fleeting shots as they try to solve their predicaments. For so many movie pieces, MacGregor, and the editing team afterwards, really brings it all together to give you the Thriller element without the shaky camera. And then there are other moments I can\'t share that help immerse me into the movie, helping give that overall picture of what they are doing. I can\'t say much more, so let\'s move to my limitations for this movie.\n\nDISLIKES:\n\nMore Morgan: Let\'s face it. He\'s a top billed actor and there is more we could have done with the talent that Morgan can bring. Whether more time at the beginning, more integration into the other\'s life, or even shots of him trying to find them would have been welcome. These moments would have integrated the story a little better, and brought that extra angle to help the solution be a little more realistic than what they did. Though, the solution is definitely unique.\n\nMore Story Needed: There were so many avenues to explore for the two girls being on the tower as long as they were. Fall had a very big opportunity to utilize the secrets they were holding and gradually reveal how deep the rabbit hole went. While from a time sake they hit the highlights, from another element they skimped on helping further explore the motifs they were trying to present. Having Morgan\'s character involved could have given even more to give these girls the best depth possible.\n\nAnimal Cruelty I did not Need to See: Animal cruelty is potentially something I do not like to see. I can handle if it has a purpose, and for one of them it did work for the sake of the story. However, an early scene showed something I don\'t enjoy seeing and could have been edited out or done a different way. Does it accomplish the horror, foreshadowing, and mood to come? Yep, but again, it crosses a line for me.\n\nSome In your Face Dialogue That\'s Cheesy: One thing that modern writers seem to have to do is rub the dialogue in your face to prove the point. Much of the dialogue was either okay or good, but there are other moments, particularly at the beginning, and some of Hunter\'s dialogue, that is really grueling. Like out of a book of Full House, the \"inspirational\" comes out a bit cheesy and I was just waiting for the actions to finally prove what the words could not do for me. I don\'t know if it was the writing, the direction, or the acting, perhaps all three, but those in your face moments did not work for me. Again, I think the target audience in this aspect will love it, enjoying the theatrics that really blow it up. But goers like me, may pray for something better and just bite their tongues to get by it.\n\nStupidity and Suspense of Disbelief Get A Little Out of Hand: One thing that is tough to avoid in these movies, is the various actions that occur to get the characters into the mess. Champion thrillers for me, are the ones that know how to craft it organically, but Fall\'s case follows the trend of our characters being stupid. The level of stupidity is kind of extreme, a bit insulting given the lessons they already learned. I mean climbing a rusted, banned tower for thrills... really that is the plot. Then as things progress, you see just how poor one of the characters is, and how stupid they seem to selectively be to push them to have to MacGyver up some quick fix solutions. Those moments are kind of too much for me, and could have changed the movie big time if they had just taken their own advice to save them trouble. And, the series of unfortunate events that happens gets a little ridiculous at times to the point of the stroke of bad luck being a tad too much. It hits comic relief and helps drag out the thrills, but at times I was like, I just predicted that would happen and you did it. This adds more cheese factor to the movie and was probably the biggest frustration of the film for me.\n\nThe VERDICT:\n\nFall was a bit deeper than I had anticipated from the trailers and cast. It blends elements of other thriller films in this category, and expands past the sorority girl motif to give us better characters. The messages are strong, the presentation and layout linear and decently paced, with acting that helps craft a better quality situation than what we got. Of course it\'s the visual and sound effects, including music, that really make the movie as intense as it is, with a fantastic blend of shots edited together to stir up any acrophobia you might have. With all the good, the movie needed ironically a little more time to fully flesh out the characters, alongside adding more time with Morgan\'s character as well. Fall\'s biggest limitation for me though is the cheese factor and how stupid the movie went sometimes. While some of the idiocy is relieved, there are other times where the lack of logic is mind blowing given the plan they had mentioned five seconds before it. Overall though, worthy of a theater visit for the effects, while definitely a recommendation to watch at home.\n\nMy scores are:\n\nThriller: 7.0 Movie Overall 6.0.'),(932,54,'9/10','Nice curve balls','josephjanz','13 August 2022','My palms were sweaty even after the movie was over.

But there is one lesson I think which is not to becoming so much addicted of being famous and internet celebrity. Now a days lots of people are running after to become celebrity in a short time. To get the attention they are taking high risks, and sometime the plan doesn\'t execute as it should be. And this is shown in this movie very delicately.\n\nThe most interesting twist was some minutes before ending. I really didn\'t think that, it was mind blowing. All of time I was thinking a way but suddenly drastically changes that. This is what I like the most about thriller movies. You never know what\'s coming.\n17 out of 28 found this helpful.

This is Nithilan Swaminathan\'s second movie after a gap of seven years. However, you get a feeling that this 50th movie or so of this already veteran director. Also, this one is in fact 50th movie of Vijay Sethupathi whose fan I had become after watching his initial movies starting from \"Pizza\". This one should be a case study of how screen play of movie should be written taking simplest of stories and how characters should be developed in the script. Any movie would be great if it doesn\'t allow you to guess what is going to happen next? The suspense should not only be edge of the seat, but it should have many wow moments that is beyond audience\'s wildest imagination. Also, it should be more than engrossing and not just that, it should take you along as the story unfolds on the screen. In such a way that you end up feeling that you are part of what is happening. Finally, it should make you think long after you return home. Maharaja does all that and becomes one of the best Tamil movies of this year and the best 50th movie for Vijay Sethupathi. Take a bow to the director Nithilan Swaminathan for creating magic with amazing screen play from a simple story. You will think it is just another simple story only when you get to decipher the complete plot of this amazing movie. And you may have to see this movie more than once to get everything that you witnessed in the first view. I am really glad that this movie just came when everyone thought Malayalam movies are doing great even with Tamil audience and everyone started asking, what had happened to Tamil movie makers as they couldn\'t cater to the requirement of Tamil speaking audience? So much was the impact that old movies were re-released in the theaters due to lack of any good new movies to compete with Malayalam to Tamil dubbed movies. Technically this movie is brilliant in all ways. The major technical success is the wonderful BGM by Ajaneesh Loknath of KGF fame. I always associate him with loud BGM that not only vibrates chairs of theater also makes you buy a bottle of Amurthanjan/Headache balm. However, this one is an exception and crisp editing by Philomin Raj. Coming to performances, Vijay Sethupathi stands out both playing the younger version (Whom I like most) and the older version with good make up and even mannerism. You will feel nostalgic about his character in the movie \"naduvula konjam pakkatha kaanom\". It is nice to see Anurag Kashyap\'s amazing performance though there is no lip sync at many places. That is just a minor glitch as you can\'t think of anyone else in that role. However, taking a comedian and make him play one of the lead bad guys speaks volumes about the director. Singampuli is just amazing, and you start hating him to the core. I can\'t take all the names as it would make this review still longer one. Yes, you can\'t forget the girl who plays Vijay Sethupathi\'s daughter in this movie. This one is one amazing movie of this year and perfect choice for Vijay Sethupathi\'s 50th movie.

He deserves a standing ovation for embodying the director\'s vision. The complexities, the writing is a no nonsense game which gets it right with a brilliant climax that lingers long after the credits roll. The first half features familiar faces from the director\'s debut, with lighthearted moments woven into the theft investigation, the police station chaos, and the antics of \"Kurangu Bommai,\" the burglar sidekick. Character introductions are swift, establishing VJS\'s family life, daughter, PT teacher role, the city\'s robbery, and the presence of Anurag Kashyap (whose dubbing might raise an eyebrow, but his performance shines in the climactic construction site sequence). For the sake of avoiding spoilers, I\'ll refrain from detailing his henchman\'s significance.\n\nAjanessh Loknath, a powerhouse known for his work in Kannada and Telugu cinema is the perfect musical accompaniment for this movie.\n\nDirector Nithilan Swaminathan, who stunned audiences with his debut \"Kurangu Bommai,\" showcases his mastery of non-linear storytelling, solidifying him as a rising force in Tamil cinema. His mastery of non-linear storytelling is brilliant. He\'s on track to be a big name in Tamil cinema.\n\nThere\'s just so much to this movie, but for now, I gotta recommend it if you\'re looking for something deeper than just a masala popcorn flick. Sure, some might compare the climax to stuff like Oldboy or Irrata, or even Villeneuve\'s Incendies (2010), but don\'t let that stop you. Ignore the overzealous puluthis who act like they\'ve seen it all - this is one you don\'t want to miss.\n\nBonus recommendation!

The place where you\'re sitting now tells a story, and these incredible stories pave the path of living. Cinema is one of the greatest forms of conveying a story. However, nowadays, stories are often diluted, and entertainment is prioritized. Fortunately, we now have a very sensitive story driven by Nithilan Swaminathan. Transforming a sensitive story into a screenplay without altering its emotions is not everyone\'s forte, but the \"Maharaja\" team has accomplished this with precision. The performances of Anurag Kashyap and Vijay Sethupathi have brought the characters to life. Their nuanced acting, combined with the screenplay, sheds light on shades of grey in human nature. It\'s a must-watch movie that deserves to be seen in cinemas. Book a show and watch it with your family and friends.\n2 out of 5 found this helpful. Was this review helpful?

There have also been movies with weak performances, loud or distracting music, dialogues, cinematography etc. But a strong story and screenplay still makes it watchable and sometimes even enjoyable. Here we have a brilliant screenplay and writing which is aptly supported by the performances, music and technical department. Then we have a great movie.\n\nIn Maharaja the story, writing and the screenplay are the heroes. It helps if the same guy who wrote the brilliant script, directs and then the performances and technical aspects elevate it to the next level.\n\nVJ has played his part brilliantly by down playing his role. He is loud and intense where he has to be and silent and timid otherwise. Though AK as the main villian is great with his performance, the terrible lipsync doesn\'t help. Supporting actors have all done their job, but the police inspector and the surprise evil villian stand out. Abhirami, Mamta and Barathiraj have a lot less to show up for. The editing in such a non linear narrative can be tricky, but we have the best man in Philo for it. It is not too complex for the audience to catch but it makes them pay attention.\n\nThe music was elevating but not distracting.\n\nSouth Indian cinema continues to dominate the art of film making.

This movie is particularly special as it marks the 50th film of Makkal Selvan, Vijay Sethupathi. Having such an outstanding film as his 50th is truly a stroke of luck and a blessing. Sethupathi\'s natural and versatile performance, where he fully immerses himself in a subtle role, is exceptional. While many movies are made for dustbin, here\'s one made around a dustbin. The film is packed with goosebumps-inducing moments, with twists and turns seamlessly integrated into the script. Natty shines in a prominent role, delivering a cool and stylish performance. Anurag Kashyap\'s deep voice and fitting body language provide a solid performance, especially in emotional scenes. Mamta Mohandas fades into the background due to the strong content, and Abirami makes a clean comeback.

[+70%]','arungeorge13','16 June 2024','After Kurangu Bommai, writer-director Nithilan Swaminathan delivers a slow-burn emotional thriller that mostly works, courtesy of solid writing and performances. The screenplay is cleverly put together; several storyline threads are deliberately left open in the film\'s first half, only for them to be neatly tied together in the second. Every character, including that of Vijay Sethupathi\'s, gets more layering than you can foresee. The tonal shifts are almost sudden, but the transitions feel smooth. No time is spent on superfluous developments. Even the film\'s only major set piece (pre-interval) is smartly staged. I do wish sexual violence stops being used as a trope for the male protagonist to execute revenge in the most extravagant ways possible - that\'s the only aspect stopping me from giving it a 4.\n\nB. Ajaneesh Loknath strikes a meaningful balance between thrills and emotionally affecting bits of the film (especially in the second half) through his work on the score. Sethupathi (who exhibits subtle shades of the performer we all loved in his earliest days in Tamil cinema) is in fantastic form in his 50th outing. Anurag Kashyap also shines as the main baddie, with more texture to his character than usual bad guys - his lipsync is off though but the essence of the performance is saved by Philomin\'s edits. Nataraja Subramanian, Singampuli, Abhirami, and the rest of the cast contribute to the film in fairly memorable roles. Mamta Mohandas feels like an add-on, just to tick off a female presence during certain proceedings. What could\'ve been a basic revenge plot gets subverted by its screenplay structure and non-linearity in presentation, resulting in a violent (and occasionally disturbing) yet supremely engaging 2h 30m affair. Due to my exposure to Korean revenge thrillers of the last few decades, the climax twist didn\'t SHOCK me.

This is one of the first and best prototypes of the buddy movie.\n\nBrest\'s casting is superb, and he elicits performances which are often the best of even young actors\' careers. Judge Reinhold, John Ashton, and Ronnie Cox are outstanding, and the ensemble clicks like a well-oiled infield. To me, this movie is still far and away Eddie Murphy\'s best performance. He is remarkably talented, a comic genius. As an actor, his expressions are sometimes outlandish, but always completely in character, and appropriate to the dramatic situation. Villain Victor Maitland (played by Steven Berkoff, the husband of Alberta Watson, Madeline in La Femme Nikita) is chillingly underplayed; the cold-blooded evil shines through the civilized facade.\n\nBHC is one of the few movies which I can watch with my loved ones again and again and never tire.

Great job reviewing one of the best classic action films ever.\n\nThis is my favorite film and one of the best classic action films from the 80\'s of all time. Yes I grew up with this film, that always fascinated me how this film is fascinated, awesome, brilliant and very funny. Eddie Murphy kick\'s ass!!!\n\nA freewheeling Detroit cop pursuing a murder investigation finds himself dealing with the very different culture of Beverly Hills.\n\nBeverly Hills Cop is a movie made successful entirely on the performance of its star. The film is fairly shallow when it comes right down to it -- really, it\'s a whole lot of talk, a fair bit of comedy, and only a little bit of action -- but Star Eddie Murphy\'s (48 Hrs.) charisma and complete mastery of his character is what makes Director Martin Brest\'s (Midnight Run) movie a fan-favorite success. Outside of Murphy, Beverly Hills Cop is as routine as routine gets; a standard cops-and-robbers plot, no mystery, and point-and-shoot and in-the-raw direction make for an otherwise dull picture, but Murphy saves the film from its own shortcomings with so much flair and genuine excitement that this might be the all-time best of any of the \"actor-singlehandedly-makes-the-movie\" movies. Beverly Hills Cop is the very definition of a \"star vehicle,\" a movie that\'s nothing without its lead -- this specific lead at that -- but with him? It\'s a movie that\'s always masking its mistakes behind Murphy\'s big smile and quick-to-the-punch comic style and timing that he\'s got going on no matter the time, place, or circumstances in the story, selling the character and his actions with a startling effortlessness that transforms him into Axel Foley in every scene.\n\nAxel Foley (Eddie Murphy) is a slick, smooth-talking Detroit detective who\'s disobedience and disregard for procedure has once again landed him in hot water with his Chief, and a promising career is on the brink of disintegration. Axel Foley is Eddie Murphy\'s best role that made him in to a star today.\n\nBeverly Hills Cop is a 1984 American action comedy film directed by Martin Brest and starring Eddie Murphy as Axel Foley, a street-smart Detroit cop who heads to Beverly Hills, California to solve the murder of his best friend. Judge Reinhold, John Ashton, Ronny Cox, Lisa Eilbacher, Steven Berkoff and Jonathan Banks appear in supporting roles.\n\nThis first film in the Beverly Hills Cop series shot Murphy to international stardom, won the People\'s Choice Award for \"Favorite Motion Picture\", was nominated for the Golden Globe Award for Best Motion Picture - Comedy/Musical, and received an Academy Award nomination for Best Writing (Original Screenplay) in 1985. It earned $234 million at the North American domestic box office, making it the highest-grossing 1984 film in the U.S.\n\nBeverly Hills Cop is always on the precipice of disaster, the picture teetering on the edge but always pulled back from the brink by Murphy\'s contagious enthusiasm and pure comic timing. About half the film, it seems, is constructed almost exclusively of scenes featuring Murphy\'s character being chewed out for his actions that take place in the other half of the film. Whether he\'s defending himself in front of his superiors or defending his life on the streets of Detroit and Beverly Hills, Murphy consistently and perfectly juggles the film\'s requirements for action (as sparse as the action may be) with what is almost always subtle but extraordinarily effective humor that always flows from the story and feels genuinely off-the-cuff, rather than force-fed into the plot just to try and squeeze out a laugh from its audience. It\'s the film\'s sense of real, genuine storytelling, then, that outside of Murphy, is its greatest asset. The film is awfully standard, yes, but it\'s never mechanical, instead playing as completely organic. The interplay between characters seems perfectly natural, as does the humor, and it\'s all thanks to Murphy\'s uncanny ability to carry the movie with so much natural swagger and charm that Beverly Hills Cop is so much fun in spite of what would otherwise be a forgettable loser of a movie.\n\nThe heat is on in this fast paced action-comedy starring Eddie Murphy as Axel Foley, a street smart Detroit cop tracking down his best friend\'s killer in Beverly Hills. Axel quickly learns that his wild style doesn\'t fit in with the Beverly Hills Police Department, which assigns two officers (Judge Reinhold and John Ashton) to make sure things don\'t get out of hand. Dragging the stuffy detectives along for the ride, Axel smashes through a huge culture clash in his hilarious, high-speed pursuit of justice. Featuring cameos by Paul Reiser, Bronson Pinchot and Damon Wayans, Beverly Hills Cop is an exhilarating sidesplitting adventure!\n\nI love this film, it is one of the funniest movies that I\'ve ever seen.

It was one of those movies that my dad would let my brother and I watch on weekends, after my mom made him promise not to show us any rated R movies, and over the years it\'s easy to forget the level of violence and profanity in it that earned it that forbidding rating. Of course, as a kid I was just excited that I was getting to see something that I shouldn\'t, but in retrospect I tend to think that it was this combination of clever comedy and the ingredients from harder action thrillers that ensured Beverly Hills Cop\'s status as a cop comedy classic.\n\nYou see, Foley has a bit of a criminal past of his own, but he is clearly much more at home on the right side of the law, and he uses his experiences in crime to his advantage in working his way into the criminal underworld, where he routinely attempts to bring down major crime ring kingpins. One day an old friend comes to visit him after having been released from prison and spending some time relaxing in the California sun. The two have a great time at the bar recounting their old criminal days together, until we learn that this guy, who once took the fall for one of Axel\'s crimes and served prison time for him without ever mentioning his name, now has stolen bearer bonds with him worth millions. Before long the owner of the bonds shows up and is not in a reminiscent mood. Axel is knocked out as they\'re staggering back to his apartment for the night, and he wakes up to find his friend murdered.\n\nThe movie follows one of the biggest 1980s action movie clichés to the letter. Every single line is here, \'take some time off,\' \'stay away from this case,\' \'if you go after this guy don\'t bother calling in on Monday,\' etc. My eyes tend to glaze over whenever I hear this situation in a movie, probably because I work so much and in such situations can only think of how great it would be if my bosses told me to take some time off, go on vacation, don\'t let them catch me working or they\'ll fire me. But Foley\'s trip to Beverly Hills to perform his own investigation yields results so promising that it keeps the movie moving along at a pretty fast pace. Of course we realize the real life odds of a police officer traveling to the other side of the country and immediately stumbling across the major crime organization that he\'s looking for, but Murphy\'s quick-talking wit and street-wise charm makes it pretty easy to root for him.\n\nThe movie has the perfect premise to combine with Murphy\'s personality – he\'s an urban cop from Detroit named Axel Foley who is always driving his boss insane because he doesn\'t wait for piddly things like authorization when he wants to do major undercover work. The movie opens with one of these undercover and under the radar missions, which culminates in the police being called and then a major car chase through city and residential streets that must have caused millions of dollars in damage. Of course, when the cops have Axel at gunpoint, he gives them a grin and they shake their heads and lower their guns. Aw shucks, it\'s that crazy Foley again!\n\nJudge Reinhold and John Ashton play Detectives Rosewood and Taggart, two of Beverly Hillss finest who are assigned to keep an eye on Foley and make sure he doesn\'t start doing police work while a dozen states or so outside his jurisdiction, from which he\'s suspended anyway. So Foley moves around among the Ferraris and BMWs and Mercedeses of Beverly Hills in his ancient, beat up Chevy Nova, cheerfully laughing at Taggart\'s and Rosewood\'s bumbling efforts to tail him and doing his investigation right under their noses.\n\nIn the standard buddy cop movie sitcom, you have two wildly different people thrown together in a police partnership situation and forced to work together. This was a staple of the 1980s and has remained popular to this day, with classic movies like Lethal Weapon, Tango & Cash, 48 hours (one of Murphy\'s own earlier comedies), Red Heat, Rush Hour (could two cops ever be more different than Chris Tucker and Jackie Chan?), and possibly my favorite, Hot Fuzz. And of course I shouldn\'t forget Bad Boys, which may very well have so much in common with Beverly Hills Cop as to warrant suspicion of plagiarism. I\'ll let it go though. I\'m sure Eddie Murphy doesn\'t mind. Anyway, Beverly Hills Cop does follow all of the basic rules of your standard buddy cop movie, but somehow manages to avoid feeling like a formula film.\n\nThe combination of Axel\'s determination to avenge his friend\'s murder is juxtaposed with hilarious situations involving Taggart and Rosewood trying in vain to keep an eye on him, as well as various police organizations tearing their hair out trying to keep him under control. Picture the police chief in Last Action Hero, a bad movie for which I maintain a certain affection, and make him intelligible and add a lot of profanity and you\'ll get some idea of what\'s going on here. I don\'t know that Beverly Hills Cop can quite be called a comedy classic, but it is definitely an action comedy classic.\n\nAlso keep your eye out for the hilarious cameo from Bronson Pinchot, who you may remember as Balki from Perfect Strangers!

Although the film cost about $14,000,000 to make, it earned back almost $250,000,000...in the US alone! And, the soundtrack from the film was almost as big--with many of the songs getting enormous airtime. In fact, the soundtrack was a HUGE hit as well. And, not surprisingly, Eddie Murphy soon decided to call it quits on \"Saturday Night Live\". On top of that, everyone seemed to be talking about the film...I can clearly remember that. Oddly, however, I didn\'t get around to seeing the film until now! And, now that I\'ve seen it, I enjoyed it but also feel that the film sure would have played better back in the day than it does today.\n\nIn this dramatic-comedy, Murphy plays Axel Foley--a freewheeling cop who seems to be the only one in the film who has a brain. He\'s smart and capable--and naturally the Detroit Police don\'t understand or appreciate him. One night, an old friend of Foley\'s shows up and after an evening partying, some assassins are waiting for them--killing the friend and sparing Foley. Clearly, Foley was not their target. Now, with the BAREST OF EVIDENCE, Foley is going on vacation to Beverly Hills to finish the investigation unofficially. However, once there, he finds the Beverly Hills Cops equally unappreciative of his talents and hassle him throughout most of the film. When the trail leads to a scum-bag named Maitland, the cops must decide whether to keep hassling Foley or jump into the fray with this out of control cop.\n\nThe plot itself wasn\'t all that interesting to me and seemed a bit more like a plot from a TV cop show. However, this is not why folks liked the film. What folks liked, and I appreciated, was Murphy\'s humor--which was very much appreciated in order to liven up the mediocre plot. Is all this nonsense great? Nah...but it is quite good and Murphy\'s charisma was a MAJOR plus. Too bad this incredibly talented guy who made this and \"Dreamgirls\" (for which he received an Oscar nomination) also ended up making \"Norbit\" and \"The Adventures of Pluto Nash\". Worth seeing, though you should be aware of the very crude language, violence and brief nudity.\n\nBy the way, and it\'s not a complaint, but HOW DID AXEL GET THAT GUN IN THE BACK OF HIS PANTS AT THE END OF THE FILM?! He was shot in his right shoulder (his shooting arm) and yet the gun is stuffed in the back of his pants---in a way that could only happen if he did it with his damaged arm. And, who sticks their gun back there anyway?

By then, I had seen thousands of movies and was starting tired of the \"new stereotypes\" I was beginning to see with regularity; reverse racism in which the black guy is always smarter than the white guy, for example. In here, it\'s Murphy smarter than all the white cops, most of whom are pictured as outright stupid. (If the reverse was shown, there would be an uproar.)\n\nIt\'s also one more example - among hundreds in films since the late \'60s - in which the renegade (regardless of color) is the only one who can solve cases.

Axel assumes the suspect is a local tycoon, but no one seems to believe him  including the police force, being semi-run by Ronny Cox (in one of his rare good-guy roles).\n\nAxel comes into trouble with the law his first day on the job after getting thrown through a glass window by some thugs. He is arrested, and when released finds himself hounded by a pair of inept police officers around the town for a few days. After outsmarting them (in one of cinema\'s most delightful moments  ever) Axel gets hooked up with an old friend and manages to roam the streets looking for clues  which, of course, he finds very easily.\n\nBefore this film Eddie Murphy had starred in one film that had launched his name into Hollywood: \"48 HRS.\" But by all reasonable comparisons this is a much, much better film, and it\'s also much, much funnier, too. What\'s most refreshing is that it doesn\'t fall back upon the stereotypes of African-Americans inherent in so many mainstream motion pictures  the role of Axel Foley was originally written for Sylvester Stallone (who was actually attached to star early on in pre-production before dropping out of the project) and it\'s quite clear that Foley was intended as a white character. Although massive rewrites were employed only two weeks before shooting, script flaws can still be spotted  the heroine of the story is a white businesswoman, for example, and we expect some sort of sexual tension between them but there is none. We begin to question the very presence of the female lead because in essence it leads nowhere. We can imagine how it might have developed into a love story, but Murphy works against the flow, awkwardly treating her as nothing more than a friend.\n\nThese sorts of things sometimes bring out the occasional odd touches in the film  ironically they unintentionally set the film apart from other such movies of the genre because it\'s not typical in any sense. Sure, it has the routine shoot-outs but there is no romance subplot, no pointless racial comparisons (more of which would be seen in the two sequels), etc. The movie greatly benefits from this because it seems so fresh, and far more believable  after all, rarely are romances developed in two days. The action genre always seems to end with the hero sending off the crooks to jail, and finally getting a long-awaited kiss from the leading lady. \"Beverly Hills Cop,\" to its credit, manages to avoid this and the result is a far more enjoyable film, even if most of its sequences are far from being 100% realistic.\n\nThe film\'s director, Martin Brest, has a clear handle on the buddy genre and would go on to direct the immensely successful Robert De Niro / Charles Grodin road-buddies-comedy \"Midnight Run,\" one of the most popular (and best) of the genre. Beverly Hills Cop works just as well  it\'s funny when it needs to be, thrilling when it wants to be, and features a stellar lead performance by Murphy in his most unusual role.\n\nMurphy is the driving force behind the film, presenting us with a truly likable character  the most likable character he\'s ever played, as a matter of fact. Axel is unorthodox but a generally good guy  Murphy is sometimes typecast into playing roles similar to that of which he played in \"48 HRS.\" (being the loud, obnoxious racist who\'s got it all together), but here he plays someone we actually want to root for. At one point in the film he manages to get a couple of police officers in trouble with their superior  but he takes all the blame, and actually fabricates a lie wherein they were heroes doing their job, despite the fact that they were all actually hanging out at a strip club. Axel is tough, cool, quick-witted, nice, sarcastic, and likable  one of cinema\'s most enduring characters, and proof that African-American cinema heroes don\'t always have to be loudmouths in order to succeed as characters (pay attention, Chris Rock and Chris Tucker).\n\nThe now-famous soundtrack (including \'Axel F\' by Harold Faltermeyer) is a great blend of techno-pop and electronic rock  the movie\'s theme is bouncy, rambunctious and fun: a good parallel to Axel himself.\n\nOverall \"Beverly Hills Cop\" exceeds exceptionally well, even if a great deal of the film\'s success itself derives from pure accident and chance. I don\'t think anyone can say that those involved in the production knew exactly what they were doing at the time (DVD supplements include anecdotes about hectic filming and the project almost falling through at one point) -- but as luck would have it everything turned out fine. \"Beverly Hills Cop\" is an immensely enjoyable film, and one of the best examples of the cop-comedy genre executed properly.'),(976,57,'7/10','Unusual Cop Movie that\'s Fun','thespeos','3 June 2021','This is an unusual \"cop movie\" as it combines serious crime, comedy, and the poor inner city world of Detroit, MI (black world) in contrast to the grotesque opulence of Beverly Hills, CA (white world).\n\nSTORY: The plot is simple, and there aren\'t any real sub-plots, but it works well.

The film was loved by many action fans, as well as comedy fans and movie buffs at the time. It is still being admired by many people as one of the funniest cop movies ever made.\n\nThe thing I love about this movie is that Eddie Murphy was perfectly cast as the Axel Foley character. Originally, Sylvester Stallone was considered for the role. Thank God he wasn\'t! Eddie Murphy was perfect for the role, because he can be a clever cop, and can at the same time be very funny! Another great thing about Beverly Hills Cop is its smashing soundtrack. There are some great hit songs from the 1980\'s featured in the soundtrack, as well as an excellent musical score which can be heard throughout the movie (to me, the musical score is the Beverly Hills Cop \"theme song\").\n\nPerhaps the only downside of Beverly Hills Cop is that it can be pretty slow in certain scenes. Hardcore action fans would probably be disappointed by this. But let\'s face it: Beverly Hills Cop is not an all-out mindless action movie. It is actually a clever comedy with elements of action present within.\n\nTo conclude, Beverly Hills Cop is arguably Eddie Murphy\'s best film since he fits the Axel Foley character perfectly. There are many funny scenes featuring Eddie Murphy that will have people laughing (even the action scenes can be cleverly funny)!\n\nP.S: Look out for cameos by Paul Reiser, Bronson Pinchot, and Damon Wayans!'),(980,57,'7/10','One of the only times Murphy\'s talents has not been misused.','policy134','8 August 2005','The first time I saw this back in the 80\'s I thought that it was hilarious. Since then the passage of time has dimmed the luster a little but I still think that this is one of the best Murphy vehicles ever. His wisecracks was totally uninhibited and it shows.\n\nSince then there has been some good and very bad Murphy movies but when this first came out, his humour was enormously fresh. His sheep-like laugh was the clincher and has since been imitated, but never duplicated.\n\nThe plot is not much to speak off and you could only wonder what a disaster it could have been if Sylvester Stallone had been cast, as was originally intended. The idea of a black man rubbing the very white people in Beverly Hills the wrong way is of course brilliantly thought out and I can\'t think of other actors who could portray the white cops better than the people chosen here.\n\nThe one thing I will always remember about this was of course the theme song by Harold Faltermayer. It had some kind of inexplicably hold on you that you nearly whistled the tune out loud every time you heard it. While not in the league of Martin Brests next film, \"Midnight Run\" it will always be a fond memory of the time Murphy could do no wrong until \"Best Defense\" was released.'),(981,57,'Sargebri','The Peak of Murphy\'s Career','10 July 2003','Was this review helpful?

This film is a funny, fast paced, action filled fun ride and Murphy really made the film an enjoyable experience. Thank God that Sylvester Stallone backed out because I feel the film would have been a very dark intense film. At least Murphy made Axel into a smart aleck who helped to lighten the mood of the film. Also, the one underrated performance has to have been Judge Reinhold. Reinhold makes an art of playing slightly goofy out of it characters and his portrayal of Detective Billy Rosewood was a perfect example of that and John Ashton was the perfect foil as Taggart.

Humanity makes a last stand at Minas Tirith, the Hobbits travel through Mordor, our heroes try to by time for Frodo to complete his mission and the Evil Sauron gets tired of the whole game and lashes out with all his might and fury.\n\n\"Return of the King\" is 4 hours of payoff, a third act in a gigantic epic rather than a mere film of its own. As such it is intensely dramatic and dynamic and you can very much sense that though peter Jackson spared no effort on the previous episodes, this is clearly his favorite. the film floats by at a thunderous pace, taking us through unforgettable moments such as the battle of Minas Tirith itself, a marvel of seamless animation and epic film-making, it demands to be seen, as it has too many jaw-dropping moments to choose from. The quieter character moments keep gaining in potency and the full weight of the stakes and their heartbreaking consequences is never in doubt.\n\nThe cast of these films have played their parts to perfection and again Jackson deserves overall credit for choosing actors that so perfectly match Tlolkien\'s creations: Ian McKellen and Christopher Lee are their own usually excellent selves, and the hobbits remain endearing, but of all the uniformly great cast, the true standouts are Viggo Mortensen and David Wenham as the tragic Faramir, whose relationship with his brutish father is the most traumatic of the film. Jackson pushes them even further by having them sing at a few key moments (a practice employed to powerful effect by Tolkien in the books), a daring undertaking that works wonders. And though he may offer one ending too many, he does have the decency to show off each surviving character with the appropriate screen time and respect.\n\nNow that the trilogy is complete, it can be viewed as one big film, as it should be. After 8 years, Jackson has done the impossible: he has taken Tolkien\'s huge legend and made films that stand on their own and have revolutionized film-making, setting the new benchmark for cinematic epics. Changes have been made to Tolkien\'s source novels, but they make for better, more fluid films, more faithful in spirit to Tolkien\'s myth than anyone had the right to hope for.\n\nA masterpiece, whether as part of a bigger whole or on its own.

The Return Of The King is the final chapter, and since it is the climax and resolution of the epic journey, it has a little more intensity and urgency than the previous installments.\n\nAt this point everyone has come to know and love all of the characters, and the stakes have become tremendously high. Kingdoms are at their knees, and the only two characters who can save the day are getting weaker and weaker. The tension was very high in this episode and I can honestly say that out of all 3 this was the only one that had me on the edge of my seat. There were many memorable scenes (one of my favourites including the part with the giant spider)that made this the classic that it is sure to stay for decades to come.\n\nThis is the longest of the series, mostly because of the ending that seems to last a while. This was a good ending, and I can see why Frodo did what he did. He, and us the audience, have gone through an incredible ordeal and I think we needed that 20 minute linger. When the battle is over, and the celebrations have ended, there is a sad emptiness felt. The films spanned over 3 years, there have been the extended cuts of course, but after that, it\'s all over. Peter Jackson gave us an ending that was both appropriate and admirable.\n\nThese were some amazing movies and this one in particular is the best, in my opinion. As whole, the Lord Of The Rings is a phenomenon. An absolute phenomenon. Much more than just movies. They have a universal appeal and have touched the hearts and imaginations of millions. I\'m one of them.\n\nSorry if I\'m being all fanboyish and kissing this movie\'s ass, but I really admire it. It may not be among my personal favourites but generally this seems to be the movie event of the century. There will never be another Lord of the Rings film, and that\'s a bit depressing.\n\nMy rating: 10/10'),(990,58,'10/10','Pretty much outstanding','TheLittleSongbird','9 March 2011','I admit it, I love all three Lord of the Rings films. People may say Return of the King is the best of the trilogy, some may say it is the worst. I personally think Two Towers is the best for its scope and better exploration of some of the characters, but while it is still great Return of the King is better than Fellowship of the Ring.\n\nMy only slight disappointment is the ending, it does feel overlong and bloated for me, almost as if there was more than one ending filmed. That said, what does make the ending at least watchable for me is the way it is shot, the marvellous score and the performance of Gollum.\n\nDespite this minor discrepancy, Return of the King is extremely good and in my view one of the better Best Picture winners last decade. Peter Jackson\'s direction is very impressive here, and the scope is massive and just dazzling to watch. All three films of the trilogy are very well made, but Return of the King defines the term epic. The cinematography is mind-blowing, the scenery is superb, the costumes and make-up are well tailored, the effects are superb and don\'t distract too much and the lighting is authentic.\n\nThe score is phenomenal. Fellowship of the Ring had some ethereal, rousing, haunting and charming themes, whereas Two Towers was somewhat darker and more complex. Return of the King merges these together and the result is a perfect mixture of charm, darkness, etherality and complexity. The story is compelling with themes of friendship, strength and loyalty, the screenplay is well-written and literate and while the film is very long the three hours or so fly by seamlessly. The characters are engaging, Aragorn is even more interesting here than he is in the previous films while Gollum continues to steal every scene he appears in.\n\nThe acting is very good. Orlando Bloom(who I can find dashing yet uncharismatic and bland) and John Rhys-Davies are given less to do but do carry their parts very well, and Elijah Wood is likable enough. Sean Astin captures Sam perfectly and provides the heart of the picture, and Viggo Mortenssen is at his charismatic best here. Ian McKellen is perfectly cast, while the design of Gollum is still superb and Andy Serkis is equally phenomenal. I was slightly disappointed by the lack of any Sarauman, but I was more than I was satisfied with the final result.\n\nAll in all, an outstanding entry to a great trilogy. 10/10 Bethany Cox'),(991,58,'7/10','Somewhat Lacking','canuck4uall','16 January 2004','The third installment of the Lord of the Rings was a good movie, however, I had many problems with the character development and acting in the movie. Sean Astin and Elijah Wood, (the only two exceptions,) played the roles of Frodo and Samwise admirably. Even with some of the adaptations from Peter Jackson\'s interpretation of the books, the story is still intriguing. However, none of the other characters in the remaining part of the fellowship suffered no more than 3 seconds of any kind of acting at a time, as nearly all the dialogue from the book is erased. And at the ending sequence, when Frodo wakes up, the cheerful scenes drag on forever, when Peter Jackson could have saved it by cutting off half the slow motion and instead, showing the last parts of the book with the burning & enslavement of the shire, and the uprising that followed. All in all, it was a good movie. Cinematic, epic, and, above all, bloody.\n13 out of 25 found this helpful. Was this review helpful?

It seems that by this time, the whole crew was tired of the project. Also, the omissions and changes to Tolkien\'s original are most glaring in RotK. The movie just whizzed by and I failed to be impressed. Maybe the Extended Edition would prove to be a more rousing experience. The normal edition, however, despite its efforts, remains a lacking ho-hum finale to what began as an impressive filmatization of the Lord of the Rings tale.\n13 out of 30 found this helpful.

Sign in to vote.','Saying that this film starts where `Two Towers\' left off is somewhat misleading, for the film starts a great distance from the walls of Helm\'s Deep. `Return of the King\' opens with a flashback of Smeagol (Andy Serkis) obtaining the one ring of power and an origin of his deterioration into the creature Gollum. This opening recaptures an emphasis that was somewhat lost within the epic battles of `Two Towers,\' at that\'s the ring. The first installment, `The Fellowship of the Ring,\' provided heaps of exposition on the ring\'s importance and influence, and in `Return of the King,\' we see it pay off, big time.\n\nAfter the armies of Isengard have been defeated due to an allegiance between Theoden (Bernard Hill), the king of Rohan, and the elves, the main threat to middle earth is now concentrated in the kingdom of Mordor, controlled by the dark lord Sauron. Sauron has turned his eye towards the realm of Gondor, the last free kingdom of men, and the wizard Gandalf (Ian McKellan) must warn Denethor (John Noble), Steward of Gondor of the impending attack, while Aragorn (Viggo Mortenson), heir to the throne of Gondor, and Theoden gather men to aid against the armies of Mordor. The dark lord Sauron needs only to regain the one ring of power to conquer all of middle earth, and two hobbits, Frodo (Elijah Wood) the ring-bearer and Sam (Sean Astin), must continue their journey, directed by Gollum, to Mount Doom, the only place where the ring can be destroyed. Got all that? If not, you need to bone up on your `Lord of the Rings\' before expecting to follow this film.\n\nSince all three epics were filmed simultaneously, each individually has the feel of being part of a larger picture - except for this one. `The Return of the King\' is just too big, the most epic of a set of epic films. Now that director Peter Jackson has brilliantly constructed the characters and plotlines throughout the first two films, he puts them to use.\n\nAll of the characters have their best moments within this film. The pair of mischievous hobbits, Merry (Dominic Monaghan) and Pippin (Billy Boyd), are no longer the tree ornaments they were from `Two Towers,\' but are split-up, and take their characters in completely new directions. Aragorn, played with an unmatched sense of honor by Viggo Mortenson, is about to meet his destiny as the future king of all men, while Andy Serkis continues his expert portrayal of Gollum (Serkis\' provided not only the voice of Gollum, but also assisted during production by acting out the scenes of the computer-generated character with his fellow actors).\n\nHowever, the real acting triumph of the film is Elijah Wood as Frodo Baggins. He continues his descent into corruption with an incredible talent that many could not pull off. Wood\'s performance is so critical to the film because it determines the ring\'s power to corrupt, which, needless to say, is absolute.\n\nThe first two films established Jackson as an incredible visionary, shooting vast landscapes from his native New Zealand. With `Return of the King,\' Jackson really gets a chance to show off. With, hands down, the most beautiful visuals of the trilogy, Jackson makes `Return of the King\' a gorgeous feast for the eyes, while never resorting to McG level over-the-topness. Jackson stays very grounded in his characters, not letting the effects tell the story, but only assist the wonderful dialogue and characters. Think of `Return\' as a mix of `Fellowship\' and `Two Towers,\' with enough action and character development worthy of ending a film event of this magnitude.\n\nThe bottom line, fans of the films will not be disappointed. Hardcore Tolkien lovers might be upset by plot changes and interpretations made by Jackson and the other writers, however, it is unrealistic to expect a completely true adaptation of the novels, being that film is an entirely different medium. Despite the alterations, Jackson consistently stays true to the major themes and ideas from the original text, while adding some of the finest filmmaking ever put to screen. `The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King\' is one of the most finely tuned and cinematically perfect films ever made.

I\'ve been disappointed with virtually every film version of a beloved book that I have seen. I have not studied \"The Lord of the Rings\" though I have read the trilogy twice and parts several times. I know what a scholar Tolkien was and admire his work in linguistics as well as storytelling. The two entities do not need to cross over. If one really wanted to make the book you would have about two hours of poetry and a 56 hour movie. Movie-making is, unfortunately, forced to play by different rules. First of all, this film could not have been made until now. Imagine people dressed as trees. Remember those old Superman serials where whenever the Man of Steel flies, he becomes animated. Now that is genuinely bad. What Peter Jackson did here will be his legacy; had he died the day the film was complete, he would go down in film history. Everything is set up. The ring must be returned. Frodo is drunk with power and is latched on by the forces of evil. Those continuing the quest must face the ultimate and some do. Gollum is in the way, using his wiles to drive the ring back to him. The visual magnificence of Mount Doom and Mordor are unbelievable. One thing that is never mentioned is the incredible acting of most of the characters. Jackson may be a master of spectacle, but Frodo\'s character is a mass of impulses and expressions. He believes he is going to die and is afraid. Do you see a little bit of Christianity mixed in here? I\'m not going down that road because, of course, the Bible is an epic too and has its own story. This is a movie about how friendship, loyalty, and sacrifice will out against evil. The evil is so remarkable and so oppressive.\n\nI can\'t begin to talk in the terms of other reviewers, but I do need to make sure that I weigh in on this film and the other two because this is a product of our society that we can all be proud of.'),(997,58,'10/10','A Brilliant Conclusion','eiratan','17 December 2003','As a movie watcher, I tend to become bored with the constant, overdone, overdrawn, underplayed, overdramatized performance and production quality of most Hollywood films. It\'s a trait that in recent years has sadly driven me away from most big budget American films. A decent idea will become mangled by the money making machine that is Hollywood, hoping to pump the most raw cash they can out of it before it drops dead in the street.\n\nWe all saw the catastophre of a failure that arose from the Matrix Franchise. Such immense hype and professed genius only made the failure all the more poignant for those of us that really wanted and expected more from the franchise.\n\nThat all being said, I must say that The Lord of the Rings is an amazingly powerful visual experience. Not even just a visual experience. Peter Jackson has crafted one of the finest written pieces of our era into THE quintessential epic. He supplements the brilliant storytelling of JRR Tolkien with one of the most awe-inspiring collection of films ever created.\n\nThe 7 hours of film that leads up to the Return of the King is only precursor though, when you sit and watch this film. It\'s just plain brilliance. Everything about the film is wonderful. The manner in which Jackson has arranged the scenes, detracting slightly from the original flow of the novel really helps to keep the suspense strong in all three story branches. The Tolkien humor is intact perfectly and the gallantry and just plain coolness of these heroes is plain amazing. (Check out Legolas in the BIG battle) It\'s all just too much for words.\n\nIf one were to gripe, and I suppose there will never be a film made that one cannot find a point at which to grip, it is painfully long running time here. I personally believe that this is the only way such a film could be made, true to the source material and completely engrossing, but I found myself more worried about the pain in my posterior than the emotional final minutes after 4 hours (including ads and previews) that I had spent in a cramped seat. As such, this will be all the better (at least for me) when it\'s release on DVD (can\'t wait for the extended...get to see the Sauroman scenes that they cut out).\n\nAs a film though, this is amazing.

Click on my screen-name and hit \"Chronological\" to view my reviews of the Fellowship and Two Towers. I make no guarantees about the quality and consistence of my review, but I do guarantee that these three films offer very high and very consistent quality from beginning to end. The acting, cinematography, art, and direction simply can not be beat.\n\nWhich of the three movies is my favorite varies with my mood  and the same holds true for Tolkien\'s books. When I am immersed in the story, ROTK is my favorite. When I simply want to have fun with the whole experience, I love Fellowship. And when I want something intense, evocative and thoughtful, I go for the Two Towers.\n\nFrodo, Sam and Golem are on their way to Mount Doom and their bodies, nerves, and relationships have borne the greatest burden on middle earth. The rest of the fellowship is rallying to the defense of Minas Tirith, and preparing for even more deadly battles to come.\n\nThe heroism and romance are incredibly moving - when was the last time you saw an entire audience leaving a theater after a fantasy movie rubbing their eyes? The sets are breathtaking - even moreso than in the previous two films.\n\nThe casting and acting are superb.\n\nThe film delivers at every level and is the jewel in the trilogy\'s well-earned crown.\n\nReturn of the King offers a resolution of all of the major story arcs in LOTR. As with the classic Tolkien trilogy, however, you may be able to predict some of what will occur, but never all of it and you\'ll never guess how you will get there. The same fatalistic and paradoxically unpredictable feeling of Tolkien\'s grand plots is present throughout ROTK especially. The major theme in ROTK, however, is the varied ways and means of heroism  both intentional and unintended, and Tolkien\'s examination of sacrifice and heroism is as inspiring as it is subtle. Amazingly, it all comes through in the films.\n\nEven more than the previous two films, Jackson and his writers took liberties with the story-line. Like the others, however, this serves the film better than simple adaptation from one medium to another. By reordering some of the chronology and adding scenes and plot devices which are consistent with Tolkien\'s world and characterizations, the film-makers actually do a better job of preserving the concepts and themes of the story than they could have with a pure adaptation. The lengthy epilogue in Tolkien\'s book is greatly reduced, reordered, and somewhat changed in order to work in the film. Some parts actually appear very early in ROTK. And some aspects of Tolkien\'s epilogue are disclosed in the Two Towers, though not directly depicted. But all of the really important components of the epilogue are, at least strongly implied if not well illustrated in ROTK.'),(999,58,'7/10','More of the same','o_willemse','5 January 2004','I loved it!

Nevertheless, the film is to able better its predecessors in two key areas. It is less monotonous than the first two, and the characterisation is better than in the first two. However, by now better character development is of no use; the story has developed much too far without effectively involving the viewer. It is almost like a pretentious effort to suck in the viewers in the final part who were warded away earlier on by poor character development. Another point worthy of noting is that it is not overlong this time  that would be an understatement. It is severely overlong. The producers just do not know how to end a film. There are so many points when you think you have reached the closure that the whole last half hour is completely anticlimactic. To look at the films in perspective, they are all of about the same in quality, which is no surprise: they are just different cuts of one long film. All are above average films, as they have interesting technical elements. But they are not successes, because the writing is not up to the standard of the other aspects of the film. Adapting to the screen Tolkein\'s story was a massive task, and it did require a lot of effort, but what one looks for when assessing a film is was it successful? Film critique for me is about rewarding success  not how much effort one puts in.

This is not an indie Oscar Winner movie and it doesn\'t pretend to be neither.\n\nStop trying to look for art in everything, like there are Bethoveen masterpieces and Tomorrowland EDM music to just jump around there are also movies to admire with all your senses and movies to enjoy on a Sunday evening.\n\nThe movie is good and it doesn\'t deserve to be bashed because people were looking for another Schindler\'s List on it.\n436 out of 660 found this helpful.

Once it actually gets to the central idea of cat and mouse between a Princess and a Dragon it\'s a lot stronger, powering through on the momentum of the endless chase.\n\nDespite a few big names in the supporting cast, Millie Bobby Brown really carries this. There\'s some really clunky lines of dialogue here and she delivers them with enough conviction to make them work. Shohreh Aghdashloo voicing the Dragon is inspired casting that really helps it get going after the weak opening.\n\nJuan Carlos Fresnadillo\'s direction does a lot to help this Netflix original come closer to looking like a real movie compared to a lot of what\'s come before. It essentially spends the entire run time alternating between some solid sets, locations and distractingly low quality CG with some good individual set pieces and ideas which remind you this is the director of 28 Weeks Later.'),(1004,59,'7/10','At least they did not destroy one of our beloved ip\'s','alexkzapf','13 March 2024','Not sure why all the hate. Is it for everybody. No. But. For what it is and intends to be. It is quite good. Elodie is not a Mary Sue. She is not perfect. Not all knowing. And. She has an arc and growing pains in her story. I will be the first to admonish companies like Disney and the Ilk for interpreting beloved characters for modern audiences. This movie does none of that. It has created a heroin that has to use her wits and smarts to win and conquer her setbacks. In a good way there are cringe lines and moments. But. For the most part. It\'s good writing and it serves the story. I know we have been fooled once too many times. But. This is not one of those. The acting is good for what the story needs. We need to be accepting of new takes on old stories. As long as they don\'t try to change a beloved story or character to push their message or what their beliefs are. Again. Not for everyone. It is enjoyable.\n103 out of 159 found this helpful. Was this review helpful?

A straight forward simple plot, basic dialogue, and surface-level only character development in keeping with the kind of fairy tale stories it is based with a little twist on the old tales in that the princess finds her own strength and makes her own choices.\n\nLocations, sets, costuming and CGI were all well done and everyone delivered solid performances.\n\nIt\'s not \"Reign of Fire\", more like a \"Snow White\", so don\'t overthink it or expect anything groundbreaking and just watch an entertaining movie.\n23 out of 31 found this helpful.

Was it a masterpiece? Nope not at all. But not every movie needs to be. Some days you just want to be entertained and this movie does the trick. Sure it was corny and predictable, but sometimes you want that in a film.\n\nBut it also held my attention for the entire run time - which is kinda impressive considering my short attention span (normally I\'d be on my phone after the first 30mins or so).\n\nPlus the dragon was brilliant. I loved everything about it. It\'s design and animation was cool and Shohreh Aghdashloo\'s voice was perfect fit for the dragon - Gravelly, but still matronly and feminine.\n\nIf you like female heroines kicking butt, dragons, fantasy and pretty special effects and just want some mindless entertainment - give it a try.'),(1007,59,'7/10','A Twist on an Old Trope','Eric266','25 March 2024','I\'m an avid watcher of the YouTube channel The Critical Drinker. He\'s a film critic who gives his reviews while pretending (I think) to be drunk. He absolutely eviscerated this movie.\n\nHowever, I quite enjoyed it. It took a basic principle of the damsel in distress and added a new twist. Millie Bobbie Brown is the damsel of the title, named Elodie. She is the oldest daughter of the King Bayford (Ray Winstone). Elodie has a younger sister, Floria (Brooke Carter) and her stepmother is Lady Bayford (Angela Bassett). Their kingdom is very poor, so King Bayford betroths Elodie to Prince Henry (Nick Robinson) from a rich kingdom run by Queen Isabelle (Robin Wright). The problem is, Queen Isabelle\'s ancestors tangled with a nearby dragon (Persian actress Shohreh Aghdashloo provides the delicious voice of the dragon) and are forced to offer a sacrifice to the dragon in the form of a princess. By having Prince Henry marry someone from another kingdom, they can sacrifice that poor girl instead of one of their own. So, naturally, Elodie gets hurled into the dragon\'s lair after her wedding.\n\nHowever, Elodie is not your typical damsel. She is smart, resilient and resourceful. She plays a cat and mouse game with the dragon trying to stay alive. Along the way, she discovers the truth about the dragon\'s history.\n\nMs. Brown is very good as Elodie. She does not come off as a girl boss. She is determined, scared, brave and vulnerable. Angela Bassett also has a nice turn as the stepmother who is anything but evil. Another trope twisted, as she is a fierce ally. Robin Wright is elegant and vile as Queen Isabelle who is willing to offer up innocent girls to save her kingdom.\n\nThe sets are beautiful and the action is well directed. The story moves along and is very compact so we learn everything without having to have it explained to us via exposition (a very common thing with today\'s writers). There is no fluff in this movie and its runtime of 110 minutes moves along quickly. The one negative in this movie is the dialogue. Its not terrible, but its not great either. Some of it is corny and some of it comes off as copied from an old folk tale. It doesn\'t ruin the movie, but it does make you chuckle for the wrong reasons.\n\nI gave it a 7 because of the dialogue and some of the scenes are so dark you can\'t tell what\'s happening.'),(1008,59,'3/10','Lame','Tweetienator','9 March 2024','Watching any episode of Xena: Warrior Princess is more entertaining and fun than this - a most stupid plot that is nothing but a melting pot of well-known ideas with twists one sees miles ahead. This is truly a most mediocre movie, a more or less soulless rehash of well-known and overused stories, woven together without much skill and intelligence, creativity. Anyway, Damsel is like too many movies these days - produced, directed, and written by people without any heart for the art of movie-making. It\'s no more art but work. What else? Production and acting are sufficient, special effects meandering between solid and rather bad computer game cinematic. Final words, Damsel is boring, redundant, generic, and as plastic as it gets - not one character one really cares about, because, well, they are all just a copy of a copy of a copy. And the revelation or twist in the end is so predictable, that it is really just lame: a couple of days ago I put Krull again on my plate - it\'s (almost) Citizen Kane compared to Damsel. Exact rate: 3.5.\n499 out of 757 found this helpful. Was this review helpful?

I like that kind of stuff so I was entertained. Millie Bobby Brown is still a young actress and since the excellent series Stranger Things it\'s obvious she will get a lot of roles in the future. She\'s definitely eye candy and isn\'t a bad actress. The movie is mostly about her so she has a lot of screen time. The special effects and CGI\'s were of good quality. The story is simple and easy to follow. You just have to be a fan of the Fantasy genre otherwise you won\'t like this movie. It\'s fun to watch in my opinion.\n203 out of 364 found this helpful.

It is as predictable as it is slow to get going, but I at least enjoyed the production and visuals throughout! The cast is okay, and nothing else. This would make for an excellent short, where many elements are trimmed (the \"Augur of Ebrietas\" slugs).. as most characters are as simplistic and shallow as shown immediately after their quick introductions, so the rest of the story would remain intact.\n\nPersonally, I don\'t appreciate movies that have little to nothing to say.\n280 out of 443 found this helpful.

It won\'t break records, it won\'t be remembered within a few hours of watching it, but it did it\'s job for the most part, and that was entertain... well it did for me anyways.\n\nThe good things about this movie are the visuals. The CGI is really good considering this is a TV movie. The costumes, set design, and dragon design are all fantastic. It\'s a good film to look at. The action scenes are well shot, and there are some very well directed scenes. The flaming bird scene for example. I was surprised how violent this was considering it was rated 12. There were some gory scenes, and some really graphic burning moments.\n\nThe characters, the world and pretty much everything else is poor. The acting is flat by everyone, even the greats like Angela Basset feel wooden, but they can\'t exactly do much with the bad dialogue they are given. Millie is ok, I guess. She\'s not bad, but not good either. I will say this, her character wasn\'t this boss bi*** like Hollywood have a habit of making these days. She get\'s beaten throughout the movie, and only has her smarts. You won\'t see her flip some 6 foot man while wielding a greatsword, instead she uses her wits. This made her a little more likeable.\n\nThe biggest praise goes to the dragon. This character had more development than any other in the film. Voiced by Shohreh Aghdashloo, she brings a very well needed thrill to this otherwise dull flick. All of her scenes were all done.\n\nBut that\'s where the praise ends. I\'m sure the writers and director wasn\'t trying to make some masterpiece, obviously, but they made a reasonable flick here. It\'s just fine.

His moodiness, his anger, his dark edge are mirrored in the character. There is hurt, anguish, and the fire that he shows so well, and I love how his voice is the main focus in his performance and not the looks.\n\n-Hailee Steinfeld is fantastic in Gwen. It\'s like taking all of her characters from her movie and integrating a piece of them into this Gwen and expanding her far into a character I really liked.\n\n-She was vulnerable and strong, a realistic character whose performance came out in spades and fully awakened the character I think they were going for.\n\n-And Moore... well Moore is just freaking amazing as Morales. That tone, vulnerability, this maturity but still immaturity cascading and once more evolving a character from the first one being believable. A stellar performance and one that I think brought so many things together, engaging with each of the others into this dynamic role.\n\n-It all works so well and I loved the strong talent bringing things to life.\n\nThe Storytelling -There are so many who say that comic movies seldom tell a good story or are telling the same story over and over again. And to a degree... they are right.\n\n-Yet... for Across the Spider-Verse, that story feels fresh, engaging, and grounded to a degree that helps balance reality and super heroism into a great mashup.\n\n-It\'s not so in your face super adventures that are all about action, violence, and CGI madness, but it also isn\'t CW bologna about exploring our feelings in colorful underwear.\n\n-This sequel really focuses so much on building up characters, but integrating it into this main comic adventure that works to keep both involved and feel like a superhero.\n\n-I love the heart into it, and the way they built up from the first movie, but yet made this movie its own thing, until the final moments where the known cliffhanger was going to come in.\n\n-And to add relative components to it, engaging characters, and keeping those characters involved in the story... that is tough work.\n\nThe Comedy To A degree -I really enjoyed the diverse comedy in this movie, and how many types of jokes and styles that were in it.\n\n-Miles is sort of a jack of all trades, sarcasm, banter, slapstick, he has a little bit of everything in it and I love it.\n\n-Others are just rambling idiots who are throwing so many jokes and statements that some eventually hit, but you have to listen because they fluctuate in terms of volume and such.\n\n-And other jokes are so well-timed and loaded with sarcasm that you just appreciate the laugh from the time alone.\n\n-It has it all and in relative balance to keep things fresh and not overwhelmingly stale as they hope from one joke to the other.\n\nThe Nostalgia and Easter Eggs -Part of that comedy comes in the references loaded into this movie almost as much as the plot in this movie, and it works.\n\n-Across the Spider-Verse, tackles many famous tropes in both Spiderman comics and movies, blending the two of them together into this natural flowing arc that utilizes it well.\n\n-Nostalgia reigns supreme in this movie, all the comic and show references of the webbed wonder just taking my child nature and taking it for the roller coaster ride of finding everything I could.\n\n-But the movie references as well... so much fun as well, seeing these micro moments and nods to the other universes and watching them blended into the comedy and story.\n\n-Then to have it just in the world, it\'s going to make for a fun rewatch potential in the future.\n\nThe Action Scenes -A huge step up, Across the Spider-Verse took my dislike from the first film and unleashed much more of the action I knew it had.\n\n-The opening scene paints for some great things to come, but soon the fight scenes and adventure transform into something that is fun, exciting, and family friendly.\n\n-Chase scenes have energy, with styles that flow and show off the heart of the animation, feels of the comic book and fan art coming together into this cascade of color and energy.\n\n-I loved the way that they evolved past punches and added more emotions and stakes that though predictable still held glimmer of exciting twists if they come.\n\n-And the fact they can punch, kick, and slam without being bloody messes should please so many, alongside the fact that the action all goes in line with the actual plot.\n\nThe Animation/Art Style -You\'ve seen the trailers and the first one and know how beautiful the movie is. Amidst the blurry backgrounds, the movie really has bold art direction that captures comic book spirit.\n\n-The computer animation goes well with the natural feel of the art, and I loved the way it felt like flipping through a flip book and seeing it come to life.\n\n-It respects both worlds so well, and like the story keeps things easy to follow and discover to appreciate everything the Spider-Verse had to offer. That was epic.\n\n-And to keep all that in relatively stable camera work, something the first movie struggled with, shows how you can really continue to improve if you take the time and think things through.\n\nDISLIKES:\n\nThe Comedy A Bit Too Forced -There are times where the humor is a bit forced for me, primarily in the moments where they just spout joke after joke after joke to the point where things get lost.\n\n-These moments are few and far between for me, but there are times where a character gets annoying over funny.\n\nSome Pacing Offsets -There are times where the movie trips up on the pace for me. A few moments where the conversations are dragged out or we get a tad touchy feeling and not enough of seeing what\'s going on.\n\n-This happened about the first hour or so for me, but once that part passes most of the movie establishes the pace I talked about for much of the movie.\n\n-At least until the need.\n\nThe Ending 20 minutes for me -The ending 20 minutes felt very dragged out as it set up the cliffhanger we knew was coming the moment it said part 1 long ago.\n\n-The ending is very drawn out, you know the movie is over, and you know what is coming, but it uses the art to drag it out, bloating the movie for the twenty minutes that could have been in the next movie.\n\n-Fortunately one of the final moments adds that fantastic bridge with music, shots, and feels that work, but still... we could have cut a few things out.\n\n-And fortunately there are no end credits, which there does not need to be.\n\nThe Sound Quality With Some Characters -It might have been my theater, but some of the characters mumble and talk fast meaning... it\'s hard to hear them.\n\n-Spider-Punk has some of the best lines, but they get drowned out by background noise, mumbling speakers, and sound inconsistencies.\n\n-This leads to missing several things and taking away from the character that seems so cool, and this happens to several other characters when there is so much noise. As such, those moments are annoying to me, but again could be theater dependents.\n\nThe VERDICT: Overall, the praise is worthy to Across the Spider-Verse, and I was very happy with much of the film that they brought to life to this theater. It\'s a sequel that does things right, taking the first movie\'s foundations and bringing with it something to build up and enjoy to the full extent. That bold and beautiful art has been refined to near perfection, and does so much storytelling alone that it\'s almost enough to go see it just for that in theater. But the movie integrates story, morals, comedy, nostalgia, and action to a degree that really feels like some of the strongest storytelling in a superhero movie. I love the authentic feel of a superhero story, and I love the passion of balancing so much in a movie without every losing track of the story to tell. Sure there were pacing issues and some sound flops for me, but that\'s really minor when it comes to the movie overall and everything they did to make this movie the middle of the trilogy, but still stand on its own. You can obviously guess I\'m recommending this for the theater, and yes families can see it as there aren\'t too much dark moments. And my scores for those who need it are:\n\nAnimation/Action/Adventure: 9.0-9.5 Movie Overall: 8.5.'),(1031,61,'10/10','Completely exceeded my expectations','heyrandom','1 June 2023','I was worried that Across the Spiderverse would not be able to match the success of it\'s predecessor Into the Spiderverse, but boy was I wrong. Across the Spiderverse blows it\'s predecessor out of the water. With higher stakes, more emotion and improvements on the already brilliant animation. My only annoyance with the film was that the British and Indian spiderman were very hard to understand, but once it hits streaming services that can be fixed with subtitles. The movie sadly does end on a cliffhanger as it is being released in two parts with the second part coming out in March 2024.

There is simply no way across the spiderverse is better. By the end of this it felt like they were dragging it out and I had lost interest quite some time previously. The animation is good but sometimes less is more, and there was less differentiation between the styles, I don\'t think bill sienkiewicz was involved in this one. I remember my emotions building in the first one, peaking when what\'s up danger kicked in in the soundtrack, but this got into some schlocky emotional teen drama territory that made me yawn. I also felt it was a bit cynical to split it in two, I\'m sure the full story could have been told in one movie which would have upped the quality of the animation too. Then there was the sense of universal danger overload that this and other stories revert to to ramp up the drama; whether a universe or every parallel universe and it\'s uncle is at stake, who cares, trying to make it bigger than before doesn\'t increase drama, that comes from character and plot development, yeah, like it did in the first one. It needed more jokes too, nowhere near as funny as the last time.'),(1034,61,'8/10','Spider-man: Middle of the Spider-Verse','matris1','3 June 2023','The good: This is a gorgeous and competently made film. With every scene / direction / frame constructed meticulously and it shows. It pushes the boundaries of animated movies and does it with style. The voice acting is good. The movie respects and pays homage to spider-man lore whilst offering something fresh (hard to pull off). Almost all the side characters feel real and fleshed out - even those with minimal screen time.\n\nThe bad: It\'s most definitely a middle chapter and the film suffers for it. The movie is long, the pacing suffers, and scenes feel drawn out - which makes sense when you understand it\'s not trying to reach the end. The movie \'finishes\' literally in the middle of a plot beat - when it didn\'t need to. Empire Strikes Back has shown us how it\'s done. It feels like pure marketing/money making tactics. A shame.\n\nShould you watch it: If you like Into the Spider-Verse - most definitely. The film pays homage to spider-man (both on and off screen) while offering something new.

The characters all have great writing and some with unique art styles like spider-punk having different art styles almost everytime we see him because he hates consistensy.

The film plunges audiences into an exhilarating journey across dimensions, where familiar characters and new faces collide in a visually stunning and emotionally resonant narrative.\n\nOne of the standout aspects of this film is its ability to strike a delicate balance between paying homage to the original while expanding its universe in unexpected ways. The first movie introduced us to the groundbreaking animation style, capturing our hearts with its heartfelt storytelling and dynamic characters. Across the Spider-Verse, however, elevates the stakes and explores uncharted territories, pushing the boundaries of what we thought was possible in this genre of movies as a whole.\n\nThe animation remains a work of art, with each frame bursting with energy, inventiveness, and meticulous attention to detail. From the kaleidoscopic visuals that bring the various universes to life, to the fluid and dynamic action sequences that leave us breathless, every moment is a testament to the creativity and talent of the filmmakers.\n\nMoreover, Across the Spider-Verse delves deeper into the characters we fell in love with in the first film, allowing them to evolve and face new challenges. The emotional depth and growth of the characters resonate with audiences on a profound level, making us cheer for their triumphs and empathize with their struggles. The film strikes a perfect balance between heartwarming moments, thrilling action, and thought-provoking themes, making it a truly unforgettable cinematic experience. However, audiences should go into this knowing that it\'s definitely a \'Part 1\' of a larger narrative in every sense.\n\nIn conclusion, Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse cements its place not only as a worthy successor to its predecessor but as a groundbreaking and unforgettable film in its own right. It expands the Spider-Verse in ways we couldn\'t have imagined, immersing us in a world of boundless imagination and emotional resonance. With its breathtaking animation, complex characters, and masterful storytelling, it stands as a testament to the power and potential of animated films, leaving audiences eagerly awaiting the next installment in this extraordinary franchise.\n\nChoosing between the two is like choosing between your kids - the first is a tighter story but this movie is far more expansive and blows the scope of the movie into the stratosphere taking risks along the way.

A bit of a mess in some parts, lacking the cohesive and effortless feel infinity war somehow managed to accomplish. Some silly plot holes and characters that could\'ve been cut (Ahem, captain marvel and thanos). The use of Captain marvel in this film was just ridiculous. Shes there at the start, bails for some reason? And then pops up at the end to serve no purpose but deux ex machina a space ship...\n\nThe past thanos part wasn\'t necessary when you think about it, they could\'ve done this film without a real \'villain\' And it would\'ve worked and been a original take on a super hero film without using the same formula we have seen in 10+ super hero films already. The entire final battle felt like a rehashed messy battle, with a bunch more characters against thanos - basically mixing the space battle from infinity war; iron man, spider man etc and the final battle of infinity war with captain america, thor etc.. mashing those two into one within this new film. The scenes of trying to pull the gauntlet off his hand.. it all felt like a rehash.\n\nTo me the best part of the film was the first act and half of the second, when everyone is lost and trying to figure out how to continue on. really interesting themes that followed the pay off from infinity wars ending. And then the time heist part. Tho the heist part should\'ve been much more stretched out. With only small parts of thanos within that, and not having him be the big bad again. But just a side character that gets in the way a little bit.\n\nAnd the setting up for \'new avengers\' to replace the beloved actors and characters we have come to associate with these films.. they do not get me at all excited for the next phase in marvel films. Falcon, Valkyrie, blackpanther, cap marvel? I just dont care about them at all. And their actors lack any charisma or depth.\n\nTo me this feels like a closing of marvel films that I\'ll really enjoy for my pop corn fix.

Directed by Anthony and Joe Russo, this epic finale to the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) represents the culmination of over a decade of storytelling and character development. Clocking in at just over three hours, \"Endgame\" is a sprawling, emotionally charged spectacle that delivers on its promise to provide closure for beloved characters while reshaping the MCU\'s future.\n\nThe film begins in the aftermath of \"Avengers: Infinity War,\" with half of all life in the universe obliterated by the malevolent Thanos (Josh Brolin). The surviving Avengers are left reeling, grappling with guilt and loss. The emotional weight of this situation is palpable, setting a somber tone that lingers throughout the movie.\n\nOne of the film\'s strengths lies in its character-driven narrative. Each Avenger is given ample screen time to grapple with the consequences of their actions and confront their own vulnerabilities. Robert Downey Jr. Delivers a standout performance as Tony Stark/Iron Man, showcasing his character\'s evolution from a self-centered genius to a selfless hero. Similarly, Chris Evans as Steve Rogers/Captain America and Scarlett Johansson as Natasha Romanoff/Black Widow bring depth and gravitas to their roles.\n\n\"Endgame\" also skillfully employs humor to offset its darker moments. The banter between characters provides much-needed levity, ensuring the film remains entertaining even during its most emotionally charged sequences. This balance of humor and pathos has been a hallmark of the MCU and is executed with finesse here.\n\nOne of the film\'s most impressive feats is its ability to seamlessly weave together multiple storylines and characters. The time-travel aspect of the plot allows the Avengers to revisit key moments from previous films, resulting in a nostalgic and satisfying trip down memory lane for fans. It\'s a testament to the filmmakers\' dedication to honoring the MCU\'s history while moving the narrative forward.\n\nThe action sequences in \"Endgame\" are nothing short of spectacular. The climactic battle in the third act is a visual feast, featuring a jaw-dropping array of heroes, powers, and epic showdowns. It\'s a triumphant moment that pays off years of anticipation and buildup. The Russo brothers\' direction, combined with Alan Silvestri\'s stirring score, elevates these sequences to a cinematic crescendo.\n\nAs for the film\'s antagonist, Thanos remains a formidable and complex foe. Brolin\'s motion-capture performance adds depth to the character, and his motivations, while morally questionable, are presented with a degree of philosophical nuance. Thanos remains one of the MCU\'s most compelling villains.\n\nHowever, \"Endgame\" is not without its criticisms. Some viewers may find the film\'s lengthy runtime a bit daunting, and certain plot elements involving time travel could be seen as overly convoluted. Additionally, a few character arcs, while emotionally satisfying, may leave fans divided.\n\nIn conclusion, \"Avengers: Endgame\" is a monumental achievement in the world of superhero cinema. It successfully pays tribute to the characters and stories that have captivated audiences for years while charting a bold new course for the MCU. With its powerful performances, humor, and breathtaking action sequences, it\'s a fitting and emotional conclusion to an era of cinematic storytelling. While it may not be without its minor flaws, \"Endgame\" stands as a testament to the enduring appeal of the superhero genre and will likely be remembered as a cinematic milestone for years to come.'),(1047,62,'10/10','The End of an Era!','ahmetkozan','25 April 2019','After Avengers Infinity War, we waited for the Avengers Endgame. We wondered how the story would go on, how our heroes would turn back, what would be the end of Thanos. Many theories related to this have been put forward. Avengers Endgame was undoubtedly the most anticipated film of recent years. Normally, the higher the expectation, the higher the probability of disappointment. But this is not the case for Endgame. Whatever you\'re expecting, you find much more in the film. This means that the biggest concern about the film has disappeared.\n\nOn the other hand, another comparison comes up. Is Endgame more successful than Infinity War? We can comfortably say it Avengers Infinity War is just the beginning of the story. Endgame was the finale of the story. So we shouldn\'t think of these two films as two separate stories. There is only one story divided into two parts.\n\nAvengers Endgame is, above all, a great homage to the ten-year history of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. The story highlights the original Avengers team. Iron Man, Captain America, Thor, Hulk, Black Widow and Hawkeye are at the center of events. No character comes in front of them. Of course there are many characters that play an important role in the story outside the original Avengers team. Everyone\'s concern was that Captain Marvel, who was included in the Marvel world, overshadowed other heroes. We can say that this certainly did not happen. What is important in this struggle is not how strong you are, but how good you are. This comes to the fore in all areas. It gives good message about being a hero and a family.\n\nOf course, Avengers Endgame has some critical aspects. For example, is the three-hour period necessary in terms of the story? It can be discussed. The head of the story moves much slower than the rest. It also drags the heroes into an emotional predicament. Then the tempo is rising and the heavy scenes we are watching are getting more meaningful. The last 45 minutes of the movie is fully action packed. But the last 45 minutes goes so fast that you don\'t even realize it. Action and battle scenes are really successful. There is not even a slight distress about visual effects. There are also slight logic errors in the film, but in general the story is so successful that these details become meaningless and insignificant after a certain point.\n\nLastly, Avengers Endgame doesn\'t have a movie end scene. Because after the film\'s final, there is no need for another scene. The Marvel legend Stan Lee appears with a small stage. But this is the last surprise scene in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Moreover, there is no clue about Marvel\'s future. This makes us wonder more about Spider-Man: Far from Home. 10/10'),(1048,62,'6/10','So much potential lost ....','CriticalThinking2','30 April 2019','After Infinity War I had huge expectations.

I\'m not saying it wasn\'t entertainment to watch but the feeling is that all heroes were forced to fit in a movie paying a big price to the story. There are moments in the movie where the rules from all other Marvel movies are broken and characters which were build over hours of screen time were reduced in order to make space for others.

The film is set in the future where Earth is threatened by a race of giant insects, known as the \"bugs,\" and humanity must band together to defeat the enemy. The film follows protagonist, Johnny Rico, as he joins the military to fight against the bugs and eventually becomes an officer.\n\nThe film\'s satirical elements are particularly noteworthy, as it takes aim at the military-industrial complex and the concept of war as a solution to conflict. The film is not afraid to be bold and make commentary on the political landscape of the time, including the Vietnam War and the Gulf War. This satirical edge is what sets Starship Troopers apart from other science fiction films and is what makes it such a fascinating and thought-provoking work of art.\n\nThe film\'s visual effects are also top-notch, with the giant bugs being both fearsome and disgusting, making them the perfect enemy to fight against. The film also makes use of excellent special effects, particularly the scenes of battle, which are both chaotic and thrilling. The film\'s action is well choreographed and serves to keep the audience on the edge of their seat.\n\nOne of the film\'s strengths is its portrayal of the characters, who are well-developed and memorable. Johnny Rico is the classic action hero, while his friends and comrades are equally interesting and unique. The film also features strong performances from its cast, particularly Casper Van Dien as Johnny Rico, who delivers a standout performance.\n\nWhile some may argue that the film\'s humor is too over-the-top and detracts from the overall experience, it is important to understand that this is a deliberate choice made by Verhoeven. The film\'s humor serves to emphasize its satirical elements and reinforces its messages. The humor also adds an element of fun to what is otherwise a dark and intense film.\n\nOne of the strongest elements of \"Starship Troopers\" is its sharp, tongue-in-cheek commentary on fascism and military propaganda. Throughout the film, characters make bold statements about the importance of enlisting in the military and sacrificing for the greater good, all while caricatured military drills and propaganda videos are played for comic effect. The film\'s over-the-top take on these themes is both entertaining and thought-provoking, leaving the viewer with a lot to ponder long after the credits have rolled.\n\nOverall, while \"Starship Troopers\" may not be for everyone, its unique blend of sci-fi action and satirical commentary is sure to leave a lasting impression on those who appreciate its distinct brand of humor and filmmaking style. Despite its flaws, this film is a must-see for fans of science fiction and action, and it\'s certainly deserving of an 8/10 rating.'),(1055,63,'8/10','fun shoot em up or compelling neo-fascist satire','SnoopyStyle','29 September 2013','In the future, humanity is under the rule of a worldwide neo-fascist military dictatorship fighting an alien civilization of giant space bugs.

Dizzy Flores (Dina Meyer) is infatuated with him and follows him into MI. Rico is in love with Carmen Ibanez (Denise Richards) but she chases her dreams of being a spaceship captain. Carl Jenkins (Neil Patrick Harris) gets into the highly coveted Military Intelligence.\n\nFilmmaker Paul Verhoeven has a trashy stylish sensibility. His love of sex and violence really works in this sci-fi schlock. Casper Van Dien is perfect as the empty-headed matinée idol lead. For the hot action babes quotient, they have the sexy Dina Meyer and Denise Richards. For a hard nose leader role, they have the perpetually angry Michael Ironside. The cast, the style, the violence, the bugs, all of it makes a great hoot. The CG is pretty good for its times. The spacecrafts could be better but the bugs look scary. There is a neo-fascist satire to it all. Of course, some may love this for all the wrong reasons. I kinda love this for every reason.

Sign in to vote.','This film is about the ignorance of conquerors and the fact that war makes fascists of us all. Now that doesn\'t sound like a lot of fun, does it. But guess what: it is fun (by the truckload - at least if you have a pitch-black sense of humour and you do realise what this film is and what it wants to achieve).\n\nPaul Verhoeven was a master at making Sci-Fi films which worked both as perfect mainstream popcorn cinema and as very intelligent social commentary on the direction - he felt - society was headed. And despite the fact that the over-the-top satirical elements and highly political undercurrents in his two previous sci-fi extravaganzas Robocop and Total Recall were only appreciated by a few critics at the time, those two films became huge hits at the box office: because they also offered great action, amazing special effects and overall great entertainment.\n\nMy guess is that Verhoeven felt encouraged by that success, and so with Starship Troopers, he didn\'t just sneak in some subversive parts: he went full-blown satire. Sadly, that didn\'t go down too well with audiences and critics alike; apparently most viewers didn\'t get the film at all (the - seemingly - good guys wear Nazi uniforms? What the heck?). Verhoeven even got accused of being a fascist, and it took the director\'s commentary on the DVD to finally make it once and for all clear what Starship Troopers is about and what the writer\'s and the director\'s intentions were.\n\nI wonder whether the studio execs realised what Verhoeven was up to with that film; maybe the director just took their 100 million dollars and ran with it. The result, in any case, is a unique oddity that I personally feel is on par with films like District 9 or even Stanley Kubrick\'s Dr. Strangelove. It\'s a masterpiece. And much like another glitch in the Hollywood machine, David Fincher\'s Fight Club, films like that rarely get made (and not with such budgets), because more often than not, they end up as flops.\n\nApart from the underlying themes, on the surface Starship Troopers also has a lot going for it: amazing effects that still hold up very well and insanely intense battle scenes with more blood and guts than even the meanest gore-hound could wish for. So no matter how it came about that a studio ever green-lit this and gave Verhoeven a 100 million dollars - I for one will forever be grateful for this unique subversive masterpiece.

When we finally saw the movie a few months later, we found it fairly interesting. You see, more than simply a silly action/sci-fi flick (but make no mistake about it, those two are certainly a factor), the movie pokes fun at 1950s sci-fi flicks, what with all the \"Know your enemy!

I\'m actually not surprised that Paul Verhoeven made a good movie with this one, given how well he did with \"Soldier of Orange\" and \"Robocop\".\n\nSo yes, the movie rips at militarism and jingoism (the essential elements of fascism), while also finding time to show the sorts of things that easily appeal to teenage boys: pumped up action and naked babes.

We talked about the veterans, how they took control & imposed the stability which has lasted for generations since.\"\n\nStarship Troopers is a cheeky inversion of Star Trek\'s post-currency, post-scarcity universe, one where wartime becomes further obsolete and diplomats are valorized over generals, and where social castes are non-existent. Instead, it imagines a post-democratic universe, where war is the only industry, conquest is the only culture, where jingoism is the common language, and where basic human rights, whether it be the right to vote or the right to procreate, are gatekept behind castes defined by one\'s usefulness to the totalitarian state, where the entire population is divided into civilians and citizens, and the only viable way to gain citizenship is by throwing one\'s bodily autonomy to the behest of the state:\n\n\"Rasczak: why are only citizens allowed to vote.\n\nRico: It\'s a reward. Something the federation gives you for doing federal service.\n\nRasczak: No. Something given has no value. When you vote, you are exercising political authority, you\'re using force. And force my friends is violence. The supreme authority by which all other authorities are derived.\"\n\nAnother quote pulled from the beginning of the movie: \"Dizzy: My mother always told me that violence doesn\'t solve anything.\n\nRasczak: Really? I wonder what the city founders of Hiroshima would have to say about that.\n\nCarmen: They wouldn\'t say anything. Hiroshima was destroyed.\n\nRasczak: Correct. Naked force has resolved more conflicts throughout history than any other factor. The contrary opinion, that violence doesn\'t solve anything, is wishful thinking at its worst. People who forget that always die.\"\n\nI have no idea why I felt the need to add this quote because I\'m just now realizing I have no commentary to add to it. It really speaks for itself. Rasczak is the embodiment of every hyper-nationalistic, militaristically cavalier conservative, as I\'ve heard that very argument verbatim about Hiroshima at least half a dozen times. Rasczak is only slightly exaggerated in that he\'s so brazenly honest in his love of violence and nation state imperialism. It just blows my mind how badly misread this movie was upon release, because it has all the subtlety of a sledgehammer to the face.\n\nAlso cheekily inverted is the character development of any movie in the vein of Born on the Fourth of July, in which a character is rapturously taken with blind nationalism through wartime propaganda, only to begin questioning their nationalism when confronted by the reality and horror of war. Rico\'s questioning phase doesn\'t come after his first experience in battle, but in the very beginning. He doesn\'t necessarily buy into the jingoism shoved down his throat through his education:\n\n\"Rasczak: Rico. What is the moral difference, if any, between a civilian and a citizen?\n\nRico: A citizen accepts personal responsibility for the safety and the body politic defending it with his life. A civilian does not.\n\nRasczak: The exact words of the textbook. But do you understand it? Do you believe it?\n\nJohnny Rico: I don\'t know.\n\nJean Rasczak: No, of course you don\'t. I doubt anyone here would recognize civic virtue even if it reached up and bit you in the a**!\"\n\nRather than beginning the story as an obedient little fascist who comes to question the state, Rico begins questioning the state and is unsure whether he believes in their dichotomy between civilian and citizenship, only to become a hardened, obedient little fascist as soon as he first encounters the horrors of war, a firmer believer in the obviously evil cause he\'s fighting for, a character arc I can\'t say I\'ve experienced depicted through a main character very often. The only example that comes to mind is Bill Hader\'s Barry, which still doesn\'t fit, because Barry doesn\'t exactly become a believer in the state so much as he just finds fulfillment in being good at something (killing people). So if anybody has any other solid examples of an inverted character arc quite like this, please let me know, because I genuinely don\'t know if this has been done with the same intentionality anywhere else before or since.'),(1060,63,'7/10','A pale reflection of the book','Bernie4444','7 February 2024','In defense of our world, school kids from Argentina willingly join the military upon graduation, as military service is required for full citizenship.

All these elements are great and work well to make the film lots of fun and highly enjoyable. Before I continue on with the praise, I feel I need to draw your attention to some weaker aspects of the film....\n\nThe start of the film was pretty cheesy; I wouldn\'t go as far as saying it was bad or boring, but it did feel a little pretentious and icky. As mentioned once the film gets going it is lots of fun, but the cut scenes between Richards and her commanding officer (sorry can\'t remember his name) were particularly dull and seemed to have only really been included to set up a crappy \'love interest\' sub plot which was not only uninteresting and unwarranted, but also never went anywhere rendering a lot of their scenes pointless. Whilst I\'m focusing on negatives, I think that the kindest way to describe Denise Richards acting would be to call it \'limited\' - although she is easy on the eye which almost makes her poor acting forgivable.\n\nBack to the praise, if a mobile infantry spending 90 minutes battling a bunch of giant creatures sounds like your cup of tea then you\'ll certainly enjoy this film. Once the first 30 minutes are out of the way then there is never really a dull moment. Aside from Denise Richards, the acting performances are generally good with Clancy Brown being a notable highlight. This being a Verhoeven film will ultimately mean that it won\'t be for everyone and those that are squeamish are advised to approach this with caution.

Roger Ebert has asked if the human race is capable of interstellar travel then why are they incapable of coming up with an effective insecticide ? A good point but why even bother with insecticide ? Surely it\'d be a good idea to send missiles containing warheads of several megatons of explosive towards the bug colonies ? No matter how much you try to explain it away you\'re left thinking of what a ridiculous idea it is to send ground troops to a planet to engage in pitched battles with literally billions of self aware homicidal insects\n\nActually I\'ve just realised why , because if humanity nuked the bugs then we\'d be left with two hours of THE OC IN OUTER SPACE with the last two minutes composed of a couple of large explosions and that would have made for an extremely boring film .

In the director\'s commentary, Mr. Veerhoven makes no bones about naming the USA as the greatest offender. In an awkwardly funny moment, his co-commenter, screenwriter Edward Neumeier, mutters \"Yeah but we did save your ass in World War II.\" To which Mr. Veerhoven clarifies, \"But this is not about World War II, it\'s about what happened *after* World War II.\" And thus, the entire philosophy is explained in a way that patriots as well as pinko commies can understand. \"Starship Troopers\" is a cautionary tale about what happens when war ceases to be a necessary evil and instead becomes an unnecessary thrill. It begins with some hilariously obvious propaganda satires, all about joining the military (including a funny scene of a 12 year old kid in full battle attire). The rest of the movie is peppered with such dark comedic skits, a lot like Veerhoven\'s \"Robocop\" a decade earlier.\n\nWhere the film is brilliant (or disastrous, see below) is in the way the battle scenes do thrill us, almost to the point that we lose ourselves in the hysteria of warfare, and only upon sober reflection do we realize that Mr. Veerhoven has just proved how easy it is to become a mindless minion of violence. The disastrous part is that I\'m afraid many audience members never sobered up and walked out of the theater thinking \"Go war!\" Such is the pitfall of making a satire; you run the risk of promoting the very thing you seek to ridicule.\n\nSomething very interesting that Veerhoven did was to use giant bugs as the enemy. I mean, who doesn\'t hate bugs?? Certainly no human I know. And that\'s the point: by presenting an enemy that\'s so universally hated as a bug, Veerhoven turns the magnifying glass on ourselves and challenges us to answer why we hate bugs, why we like to kill them so violently (crushed until their guts spew out) or gassed so that they die of painful asphyxiation before our eyes. If you caught the message of this film, you\'ll probably think twice about stomping that little spider who had the misfortune of being sighted in your presence.\n\nOh a final note that\'s a very nice touch. There\'s a scene in this film where a bunch of kids are stomping on cockroaches.

It is like the opposite of Star Treck: instead of a world federation searching for peace and knowledge, it is a world federation looking for what all earth empires have been looking for throughout history. It may also be seen as a parody of many blockbusters\' genres, such as high-school, war, and monster. Special effects worked well and the bugs and starships were nice.

Although not a film to be taken seriously, I think some problems should be solved in order to have a higher level satire: some events appear suddenly without showing how they happened (what seems to be an edition problem); many reactions and acting are not minimally credible (such as characters being happy or relaxed after beloved people be murdered); gringoes do not fit to play Argentine characters; some action scenes just last too much. Anyway, the outcome balance is positive.'),(1069,63,'9/10','I hadn\'t rewatched this since my younger years fearing it would be too cheesy for older me to watch...

It has got some really cheesy moments but it all works really well. This movie is campy where it needs to be, cheesy and serious all at the same time.\n\nIt\'s clear they used a LOT of practical special effects wherever they could, mostly in human body parts and blood. This is a very gory movie, which I tend to shy away from, but in the way it is used here it works well. I love some of the lines like \"they sucked out his brains!\" it reminds me of campy 50\'s sci fi.\n\nDespite this being a B(ish) movie they do a pretty good job at developing the characters. We see them as recent high-school graduates moving onto college or in this universe military training. We see them develop and grow as the story progresses. You end up caring what happens to these characters which for me is a mark of a well told story. Plus most of the human characters are used as cannon fodder against an unending tidal wave of baddies.\n\nI would recommend this to anyone who likes action/sci fi movies with a TON of gore. Think of a cheaper, cheesier version of Aliens but with larger outdoor battle scenes that give the feeling of scale.

Starship Troopers, the book, was built around the theme of service. It is a pretty controversial book in that Heinlein makes the case that only those who have served in the military, i.e. served a cause bigger than themselves, should be enfranchised with the vote as they have demonstrated themselves to be responsible enough to think about more than just themselves.\n\nYou won\'t get any of that out of the film. Instead you will get mindless action and violence that portrays the military as incompetent and fascist.(Combined-arm tactics - what\'s that?)\n\nThe betrayal of Heinlein is so complete that it cannot be a mere accident. Clearly the writers and director of the Starship Troopers movie despised Heinlein\'s views.

The costumes are excellent, the cast are terrific, with Mel Gibson as Max particularly impressive, and here we have villains to truly fit the word villainous, but it\'s the stunts and chase sequences that makes this film a rich rewarding experience. The opening ten minutes alone are pure adrenalin pumping genius, but the film as a whole delivers a crash bang wallop punch that has often been imitated since its release, but rarely bettered, and although the heart of the film is a simple revenge story, it grabs your attention and delivers right to the corking finale, 8/10.\n\nFootnote: Region 2 Users should note that the bargain bucket Mad Max Trilogy flip pack set still contains the foolishly dubbed version of this film, incredibly stupid move from the American distributors.'),(1078,64,'7/10','Mad Max is 70\'s classic dystopian action film the film that became the first in the series that launches some awesome great sequels.','ivo-cobra8','3 October 2015','Mad Max is 70\'s type of classic dystopian action film the film that started it all and became the first in a series that launches some awesome great sequels.

I remembered it as an exciting near-chaos-future adventure with highway cops in muscle cars and one insane biker gang. It\'s great how it keeps on standing the test of time. High speed and raw power are of every age, past and future. The way the highway action is shot in this movie simply stays exhilarating, putting it in the top ranking of best high-speed-chase movies ever. Seeing the camera follow the highway marker at high speed, along with the sound of a bike- or V8-engine delivers a Mad and chaotic but really cool result. The pace of the movie remains considerably high, without many slow moments.\n\nSome aspects of the movie have (understandably) dated. Obviously the 70\'s clothing and hair styles. Sometimes the acting is a little over the top, and some characters could come directly from a comic book. And of course the story is not that deep or difficult. It\'s partly action-thriller, partly science fiction adventure. All weaknesses are covered and compensated by lots of a-moral fun though.\n\nAt the heart of this one of a kind look movie, there is a hero character named Max. This speed-demon-cop is at the top of his game on the highway, ruthlessly dealing with maniacs ravaging his jurisdiction. But he is also a happy family man with his wife and son. This duality makes the character human, timeless and very memorable. In some scenes you can clearly see Mel Gibson was only just getting into acting. For a rookie he was doing a good job nonetheless.\n\nOthers strengths lie within the scary nature of the biker gang. An extravagant rag-tag band of maniacs, led by the iconic villain The ToeCutter. To this day, their actions remain tough and very disturbing. It will have you staring at the screen dead serious, making Max\' battle against them even more gratifying.\n\nThere is much to say about this movie, but first and foremost it is a must see.

After clashing with the Night Rider, he incurs the wrath of his bikie buddies Toecutter and co. Toecutter has to be one of the most scuzziest and at the same time coolest bad guys.

A true winner.\n\nHighly recommended.'),(1081,64,'7/10','The Potential of the Australian Film Industry','MrBenWhite','8 April 2005','Dr. George Miller\'s low budget Mad Max franchise impacted on Australian culture and altered the perception of Australia and Australians overseas in a way that no other Australian film had done. The films explores themes such as \'man and the environment\', \'fear provoking post-apocalyptic future, family\', \'masculinity in crisis\', \'good versus evil (Max as an iconic hero), Australian ethos and car culture; themes often featured within Australian films yet presented in a stark and dramatic way. The cinematographic impact is powerful; the human and emotional appeal is timeless.\n\nAustralia\'s barren deserts presented the ideal setting for a post-apocalyptic environment. The film set is more identifiable as Australia as it was filmed around the city of Melbourne. Long deserted roads feature significantly in the film and the cinematographic device of taking long distant shots of Max demonstrates how small he is in the scale of the environment that he is living. It is a relentless, unforgiving environment which demands defeat or survival and marks the characters which play upon its stage.\n\nJust as the physical setting is stark and desolate, the time setting and its associated events create an atmosphere of fear and foreboding which plays on the minds and emotions of contemporary viewers. In this fear provoking post apocalyptic future the few survivors of the nuclear holocaust are in warfare with one another, the rebel bikers and the police.\n\nGood versus evil is a dominant discourse in many film genres and one which embraces the Australian ethos. Max possesses some highly valued \"Australian\" traits; in particular, those of the underdog, the battler, the hero. External forces beyond his control stop him from \"winning\" completely. Contrary to the Hollywood hero, the Australian hero is a pawn in the game of others, which explains why Max can never quite \"win\" in absolute terms. There is little public glorification of success in Australia; heroes are remembered for their style rather than for their achievements. (Venkatasawmy, 1996) Mad Max represented a tradition hero, a hero to whom many diverse cultures are able to relate, as a story of a lone hero is a story that goes back through centuries of storytelling, and as a consequence the film achieved colossal success within Australian and around the world. The Australian cultures and lifestyles shown throughout these films give Australians an understanding of their country in the landscape, the language, and the way we treat people, life and life in exceptional circumstances.\n\nReference Venkatasawmy, R.

Sign in to vote.','It was the very rawness and budgetary constraints of this little flick that made it what it was. A new kind of action hero in a new kind of world! Gibson\'s laughably underpaid (though unavoidably so) contribution cannot be underestimated. He imbued Max with more than the script actually merited. An attitude perhaps that struck a chord with many office-desk (wannabe) vigilantes. After all, Max takes control of his own life - is not cowed by authority. Max is everyman, the one inside us that few get the chance to let loose. He is part Jesus, part Che, part James Dean, all Australian yobbo! But this guy gets the job done - drop Max into Iraq next month and see how far Saddam Hussein gets trying to stock up on sarin!\n\nRaw energy is what MAD MAX was all about! Distilled, tempered and inflamed by the time THE ROAD WARRIOR came around but at this juncture. a man on a mission and with the best tricked-up car since....well, THE CAR ! For those of you incidentally, totally mortified that his glorious black-hearted Interceptor was rendered dead-meat in MAD MAX 2, be comforted by the fact that it DOES in fact reside still in a museum in London (Why there and not Sydney I know not...perhaps for the same reason Australia still is not host to the cricket-ashes urn!) What chance of either\'s return when Greece can\'t even get the Elgin Marbles back?\n\nMuch has been made (and remembered) of the high-power car chases in this film, held by many in absolute reverence. In fact after the main cops vs The Nightrider work-out in the first few minutes of the flick, its pretty much all downhill in the action stakes - nothing subsequently in MAD MAX (1) comes near this brief sequence. This situation (with a way bigger budget) was inarguably reversed by the time THE ROAD WARRIOR came along. The stunts in THAT film have never been surpassed and remember this was without CGI fx.\n\nMAD MAX has that indefinable \'something\" the sequels didn\'t...perhaps just a raw innovation couldn\'t be duplicated - rather like ur first kiss. It might not have been the best, but it sure IS fondly remembered.'),(1083,64,'6/10','Is Max really mad, or merely just misunderstood?','film-critic','9 August 2009','\"Mad Max\" is one of those films that is on everyone\'s top film lists. Not only did it introduce us to Australian cinema, but also a young 21-year old newbie named Mel Gibson. \"Mad Max\" was dark, it was brooding, it was destructive, and it never gave us that glimmer of hope for humanity, but now - nearly 20 years later - does it still remain the classic that it started? Sure, it was impressive to watch the crash scenes, it was powerful to see the world through Mr. Miller\'s disturbed eyes, but is it re-watchable? Does it have the appeal to see new things throughout if watched and watched again? For me, the answer seemed to float near \"no\". While I loved what \"Mad Max\" represented, what it was - a full body of color and action - it wasn\'t something to be watched again and again. Gibson does a great job as Max, a man torn between the evils of the road and his personal philosophies. He begins as an ominous optimist, able to stop crime as it occurs on the streets, but then as his sense of normality is turned upside down, his ability to react and adapt is seen. The final moments, he has transformed from the man we were first introduced to into something quite terrifying. One could also compliment Mr. Miller\'s directorial outing, at times it felt a bit episodic with tough edits placed, but for the majority he told a deathly story with great ease and excitement. So, again, there is no arguing that \"Mad Max\" is an important film, one that I am glad to have finally seen, but once was enough. It seems to be lacking that re-watch excitement.\n\nBut why has that conclusion been made? What makes \"Mad Max\" mediocre instead of powerful? It is hard to pinpoint the exact scene, but the sense of \"alright, I\'ve seen it - now what\" was definitely present by the end. Yet, there were points that I just loved. Gibson was perfect. He was incredible as Max, and the world that Mr. Miller created was intense. The opening scene, the car crashes as our bearded villain just yelled \"Toecutter\" was fantastic. \"Mad Max\" has one of those openings that just pulls you in, that makes you excited to watch a film of this intensity, but then where do you go? Miller seemed to indicate that more car crashes, more violence, more cliché family drama would indicate a stronger film. At times he was right, his ability to create different scenes set across the same backdrop demonstrated his originality, but then there were times where it just felt recycled. One scene that stands out, is where our gang of bikers track down a couple that happens to be at the wrong place at the wrong time, they chase them down and demoralize them as Max and his partner find them - then, almost repetitively, it happens with Max and his girl later in the film. In this post-apocalyptic world, there seems to be no problem finding someone. Space seems to not be a problem. This was another unexplained moment - where the coincidence of discovering Max or finding the biker gang should have been more difficult. These repetitive, essentially simplistic scenes seemed to detract from the power of what Max represented. One also needs to ask about the story, the unknown of what time or place we are following Max - would this have strengthened the story knowing what world we lived in? The understanding that this was a low-budget film was rooted in my mind, the techniques provided were impressive, but should that have been neglected for mediocre storytelling? Perhaps I misread this film, perhaps I missed the joy of why this is hailed as such a cult success.\n\nAnother weakness against \"Mad Max\" has to be the relationship between his wife/girlfriend and child. Again, the lacking story helped confuse this viewer as to what dynamic they had, but when we have scenes in which the child is completely forgotten about - it just decimates the reasons behind Max\'s anger and utter breakdown. There were several scenes in which I yelled at the screen, \"What about the child\", then finally they would remember - he seemed to fade in and out of existence too often for one film. Then, when disaster strikes, we are forced to believe that suddenly Gibson would release his inner rage? It just didn\'t work. The same can be said for his wife/girlfriend. A stronger definition of character, and even more lines spoken would have helped me see the relationship. She seemed angry at first, the product of a failed marriage forced by this post-apocalyptic world to stay together, then we were introduced to love, then suddenly, she moved to idiocrity. Who would believe that running down a road, when there are open fields around, is the better option? It was these small inconsistencies that forced \"Mad Max\" from greatness to just another average action film. Two-plus hour sweeping epics aren\'t always needed, but stronger characters do help in creating the world that we, as viewers, are to inhabit for 90-ish minutes.\n\n\"Mad Max\" is an important film, there is no question in my mind about that. The door that this film opened for future cinema in America couldn\'t have been done by a better group of filmmakers, but it isn\'t a promising classic. I could not watch this film again. The sequels I am ready for, but this ride is over - and the park is closing. I realize that I am in the minority, but \"Mad Max\" is a low-budget film that uses repetitive film-making as its staple - originality is present, but you must search to find it.'),(1084,64,'4/10','It\'s a slow and uneven movie','cricketbat','23 November 2018','I wanted to like Mad Max more.

The music swerves from schmaltzy to bombastic, often drowning out the dialogue which is too low in the mix.\n\nOnly half the cast can act, with Hugh Keays-Byrne nearly stealing the film as the Toecutter, while Joanne Samuel (Jessie) and Steve Bisley (Goose) are also very watchable. Mel Gibson works on an early version of his \'handsome crazy guy\' routine that would serve him so well in the Lethal Weapon series.\n\nI don\'t think it\'s a spoiler to say that the best of the film\'s many action sequences is over and done with at the beginning. The car and bike stunts are spectacular but oddly scheduled through the movie - the climactic revenge taken by Max seems pretty low-octane compared with what\'s gone before.\n\nIn the end it\'s a odd mixture: cheap horror-movie crash zooms, white-knuckle stunt work, gentle romantic sequences, homo-erotic leather gear. It put Australian movie making on the map, albeit briefly, and spawned many sequels, even if no-one\'s quite clear about where or when any of it is set: is this post-WW3, with society struggling to survive? Is it a dystopian near future? Is this just what the Northern Territories are pretty much like already?\n\nDon\'t think about it too hard.

Beyond the Thunderdome is still pretty amazing even today, and The Road Warrior is good and holds up fairly well even with its cheesiness. The original Mad Max is a complete waste of time. Long, boring sequences of people driving over backwater roads comprise about 70% of the movie. The \"revenge\" plot doesn\'t happen until 20 minutes before the end, as many have pointed out, and the \"apocalyptic future\" setting is something you\'d never know from the movie itself - honestly anyone who says that is superimposing their memory of the later films over this one.\n\nMost of the film is trying to build up to the final payoff, but it just doesn\'t work with today\'s pacing and audience. There\'s no story otherwise and the action is laughable by current standards. I really have no idea why there are so many positive reviews, other than the movie was probably good for its time and it helped spawn a tremendous series which went on to influence many other great stories and media (the Fallout games, for example).

It is still to this day a genre and film landmark, and ties with \'Alien\' as Ridley Scott\'s best film, despite being disliked at the time it has rightly gained its reputation as a classic.\n\nHearing that there was a sequel over thirty years later left me with intrigue, with a great cast (Ryan Gosling and Harrison Ford), one of the best cinematographers in the film industry today in Roger Deakins and with an equally great director on board (having liked to loved Denis Villeneuve\'s previous films), but also nervousness considering (with notable exceptions) the general reputation with sequels. \'Blade Runner 2049\' turned out to be well worth the wait, it is easy to see why it will alienate some with its very long length (can understand the overlong criticism) and slow pace but it is even easier to understand the acclaim the film has received.\n\nIs \'Blade Runner 2049\' better than \'Blade Runner\' or on the same level? No. Is it nearly, or shall we say just, as good? Yes. To me it is one of Villeneuve\'s better films along with \'Sicario\' and \'Incendies\' (my least favourite of his is \'Arrival\' and despite being an understandably divisive effort to me it was still good) and one of the exceptions to the general reputation of sequels. A sequel that treats its predecessor with respect (including some thoughtful and cleverly done nods to it, including quotations from the original score, even Ryan Gosling\'s name is a nod to the original author Phillip K Dick) and also its audience with respect. Despite its faults, it\'s also one of my favourite films of the year, and this year has been very hit and miss for films so this is saying quite a bit.\n\nSure \'Blade Runner 2049\' is not without its flaws. Can totally see where people are coming from criticising the length, most of the time it was not a problem but some of the time there was a sense that the length was too inflated, 20 minutes could have trimmed with no problem at all. There are a few implausibilities and contrivances here and there towards the end and much more could have been done with the underdeveloped character of Jared Leto (the only weak link in the cast, he doesn\'t have the presence to pull the role off and doesn\'t look comfortable or interested).\n\nHowever, \'Blade Runner 2049\' does a huge amount right. It looks amazing, it\'s impeccably and imaginatively designed with some of the best special effects seen in a long time. It\'s Deakins\' cinematography that particularly stands out, darkly gritty, gorgeously fluid and beautifully audacious Deakins shows that he is fully deserving of being considered one of today\'s best cinematographers. One cannot praise \'Blade Runner 2049\' without mentioning some of the best directing Villeneuve has ever done in a contender for the best directed film of the year (well between him and Nolan for \'Dunkirk\'), he is absolutely the right man for the job and shows himself to be not only completely at ease with the material but also tailor made for it. Once again there is a beautiful darkness but also a hard edge and sense of wondrous awe.\n\nAnother big standout is the synthetic music score by Benjamin Wallfisch and Hans Zimmer, so well done and fitting that one doesn\'t miss Johann Johannsson that desperately. Though imagine what the film would have been like with his involvement, from my understanding he was originally meant to do the music but was fired for reasons that are a mystery to me and Wallfisch and Zimmer were parachuted in and did marvellously with big shoes to fill. It\'s appropriately hauntingly discordant, heart-pounding and tension-filled, with seeming echoes and quotes to the original\'s score. The sound effects are clever and thrillingly authentic, like for example the replicated wolfhound.\n\nWhen it comes to the writing and story, \'Blade Runner 2049\' also triumphs, even if the story is not perfectly executed. The action-oriented scenes and conflicts are filled with tension and suspense as well as ingeniously choreographed, a fine example being the masterful prologue which has to be one of my favourite opening sequences of 2017. The science fiction elements are positively awe-inspiring, often making my jaw drop, while the philosophical ones are incredibly thought-provoking and never heavy-handed (many films have made a hash with this aspect, it was refreshing to see a film doing it well). Despite being a long and slow film, a vast majority of the film was richly rewarding, with a delicious quiet tension and absorbing mysterious elements.\n\nExcepting Leto, the acting is great. Best of all being Harrison Ford as a suitably world-weary Indiana Jones-like Deckard, that and the \'Apocalypse Now\'-like meeting with Ryan Gosling providing a nostalgic element, and a deliciously cold-hearted Sylvia Hoeks (her character and performance being what Leto\'s character and performance should have been). Ryan Gosling also plays it straight to great effect.\n\nAll in all, despite imperfections this jaw-dropping, richly rewarding, very respectful and visually stunning follow-up is just as good, if not quite as, as the 1982 masterpiece and one of my favourites of the year. 8.5/10 Bethany Cox'),(1095,66,'9/10','A phenomenal sequel','SebMoz','19 March 2021','It\'s very rare when a modern sequel/reboot is equal to the original in terms of quality, but this movie is that rare one.

You can tell all by yourself and I reckon even without having seen it on an IMAX screen (though I would have recommended it and still am).\n\nHaving said all that, the movie has also the same irritating feeling about it, that the original Blade Runner had. So in almost every aspect it is a successor to it. Story wise obviously too, though I guess this one has a couple of shorts that play before this movie, that are supposed to get you in the mood. They are not necessary to watch, but they are also very well made. This movie is an experience and it is one you have to be willing to make.\n\nWhile it does have some action scenes, while it is Science Fiction, it does play more like a slow moving drama with a lot of mystery elements to it.

Yes it\'s a sequel, but it\'s quality and it stands on its own. This is real sci-fi, made with a proper budget and brought to life by artists. It\'s serious and paced so that you have time to think. If you\'re a fan of the genre and can appreciate some ambiguity and a little space for questions to breathe then I think you will appreciate this film. But if you can\'t remember the last time you read a book then maybe you will find this movie long and boring.\n\nThe cast, acting, and plot are all quite good with only a few misses. The soundtrack doesn\'t blow me away but it\'s suitable. The visuals are incredible though and where this movie really shines; I can\'t think of a single moment in the film where I felt like the vision was held back by the technology available.

Gosling imbues his character with a very compelling façade, which starts to crumble as his humanity takes over his mechanical design.\n\nThe equally thrilling performances by Jared Leto, Ana De Armas, Robin Wright, Carla Juri and of course Mr. Harrison Ford, forge a credible bond with the audience and enhance the visual grandeur created by cinematographer Roger Deakins and production designer Dennis Gassner.\n\nAnd although \"Blade Runner 2049\" may not achieve the same level of force as its predecessor, it is a tremendously immersive, philosophical and touching experience, that should be enjoyed on the largest screen possible.\n\nThe movie\'s pace is deliberately patient, which may confuse some members of the audience. But by slowing down and observing, the audience can revel in the immensity of the images.\n\nThe more we move, inexorably it seems, towards the do-or-die reality of \"Blade Runner\", the more vital these stories become.\n\nWhatever the box-office-fate of \"Blade Runner 2049\" will be, the long wait has paid off. It is far more than just a quick cash-in on a cult classic or an overly devoted sequel. It stands on its own and adds many new layers to the question: \"What makes us human?\"\n\nAnd it urges us on to find the truth in the rain.'),(1099,66,'7/10','Too much style over substance','frankde-jong','10 February 2024','Denis Villeneuve is today without any doubt the most prominent Canadian director. In recent years he was mostly active in the crime (\"Prisoners\" (2013) and \"Sicario\" (2015)) and science fiction (\"Arrival\" (2016), \"Blade runner 2049\" (2017), \"Dune\" (2021) and \"Dune part II\" (2024)) genre.\n\nIt requires a lot of courage to make a sequel to such a cult classic as \"Blade runner\" (1982, Ridley Scott). \"Blade runner 2049\" is situated, as the title already indicates, in 2049 and therefore 30 years after the story of \"Blade runner\".\n\nThe theme however has remained the same, the fear of robots taking over. This fear is with the discussions about Artificial Intelligence in 2024 even more relevant than it was at the time of release of \"Blade runner 2049\".\n\nRelevance is however not the same as originality. In \"Blade runner\" (1982) the fear of Robots taking over was further elaborated upon in the fear that they could adjust their own expiration date. In \"Blade runner 2049\" (2017) it is the fear that they can reproduce. Variation within a theme.\n\nThe cinematography is brilliant, perfectioning the decadent atmosphere of the 1982 film and having 3D technology as an extra.

There\'s clearly so much intentionality and careful effort and planning that went into making that world. Villeneuve blended call backs to the original while still making this his own vision. I\'ll see anything he makes because I always feel like I\'m in good hands with his movies, right from the opening scene.\n\nThe music had a similar feel to the visuals in that they blended old and new. The iconic \"Tears in Rain\" melody receives a much-deserved return in a delightfully appropriate moment. I\'ll give the movie serious props for providing a comforting level of nostalgia without ever feeling that it pandered.\n\nJoi (Ana de Armas) and Luv (Sylvia Hoeks) were fantastic in their own very different ways. Joi, who plays Gosling\'s love interest of sorts, is essentially Samantha in Her, except she is a holographic projection instead of only a voice. Luv is Jared Leto\'s favorite replicant assistant and a total ice queen.\n\nGosling was cool and dutiful, though kind of lifeless, which I guess was on purpose since he plays a replicant (or does he?) Juxtaposing him with Harrison Ford really made the subtleties of Ford\'s performance stand out in a way that was absent for Gosling. But Gosling was still very handsome and that worked well with the rest of the movie, which is striking and beautiful.\n\nEven though I didn\'t feel bored during any of the 164 minutes, I often felt like nothing was really happening. Even at the end I wondered what was the point. I know it was a character exploration of K (Gosling), like the first was of Deckard, and he clearly grew during the story. Still, the movie overall came across to me as heavy on striking visuals and light on substance.\n\nPerhaps I\'m demanding too much. While I enjoyed the heck out of the movie and would watch it again in a second, it fell slightly short of the profound best picture level movie that I hoped it would be.

K hunts down an old Nexus 8 and in the process, he discovers a surprise which leads to Deckard (Harrison Ford). Joi (Ana de Armas) is K\'s holographic computer girlfriend. Mariette (Mackenzie Davis) is a prostitute.\n\nThis is pure cinema although I can see some object to the length and dark depressing sensibilities. For the most part, the action is not intended to be fun. Some people will feel the long running time more than others. An easy test is whether the person likes the original or any cyberpunk sci-fi anime. This takes the original\'s visual mastery and adds a more compelling detective mystery. Any BR fan will undoubtedly love this unless they are some nitpicking fanatic. Non-fans may find this more appealing... or not.\n\nThe original\'s detective story and pacing are its major flaws. This sequel has a real detective story with a real mystery. The writing is impeccable. The designs take the original vision and dives right in. Roger Deakins\' work is beyond beautiful.

All those memories have not been lost in time, like tears in rain, but rather are indelible images from one of the greatest science fiction films. Thus, any thought of a sequel evokes mixed emotions. Despite the involvement of Ridley Scott, the results could be another disaster like \"More American Graffiti,\" or an undistinguished but palatable followup like \"2010,\" or a companion masterpiece like \"The Godfather Part II.\" Fortunately, \"Blade Runner\" cultists can breathe a sigh of relief; while \"Blade Runner 2049\" may fall short of the unqualified masterpiece status of \"The Godfather\" sequel, at least on an initial viewing, the film enhances and builds upon, rather than diminishes, the original; however, only time will determine if \"BR2049\" will enjoy the same repeatability as the first film and join it as a timeless classic.\n\nFresh from his outstanding work on \"Arrival,\" director Denis Villeneuve helmed \"BR2049\" with a steady hand and attention to detail, which were likely guided or inspired by Ridley Scott. Set thirty years ahead of the original film, Roger Deakins\'s career-best cinematography captures a future that is colder and bleaker than that portrayed by Jordan Cronenweth\'s original work, which has a warmer tone. However, Deakins\'s cooler hues are appropriate for 2049 Los Angeles, where snow has replaced rain and holographs rule rather than neon. Warm or cool, the atmospherics in both films are equally dazzling. The aurals are as captivating as the visuals; the haunting music by Hans Zimmer and Benjamin Wallfisch evokes the original Vangelis score without plagiarizing.\n\nThe casting is also superb with Ryan Gosling spot on as K, the blade runner whose job, like Deckard\'s in the original film, is to retire renegade replicants. While the role may lack showy moments for an actor, Gosling\'s tall lean figure and enigmatic face create an image possibly more enduring than that of Harrison Ford in the original. Both Ford as an aging Rick Deckard and Edward James Olmos as a retired Gaff return to link the sequel to the first film. Among the newcomers, Robin Wright is well cast as Gosling\'s deadly serious, deathly pale Lieutenant Joshi of the LAPD. Ford and Olmos are not the only returnees, an origami figure and a small wood carving wordlessly connect the two Blade Runner films, and implanted memories, flying cars, outsized advertising, and transparent plastic raincoats also have encores.\n\n\"Blade Runner\" cultists are best served seeing the sequel knowing little; the story unfolds as a policeman sent in pursuit of a mystery that expands upon threads in the original movie. Tthe film\'s length is arguably excessive, especially for those unfamiliar with the original, and \"Blade Runner\" novices may be left behind by a leisurely narrative that prizes visuals above action. However, \"Blade Runner 2049\" is that rarity of movie sequels, a film that enhances and elevates the original, yet stands on its own as a masterful film. The passage of time will determine if \"Blade Runner 2049\" and \"Blade Runner\" become the inseparably coupled films that \"The Godfather\" and \"The Godfather Part II\" have become, but all the elements are in place.'),(1107,66,'mulhollanddriveway','Pure Awesomeness','6 April 2021','Was this review helpful?

I just don\'t understand why this movie got made. It looks like it\'s got a budget. It\'s shot decently. Nothing to write home about, but it suffices, I guess. The audio is pretty terrible, though. There are many parts throughout the movie where the sound goes up and down and it\'s really off-putting.\n\nI guess, if you have nothing else to watch and you\'ve consumed many, I mean MANY, mind altering beverages and you desperately need some background sounds to listen to as you\'re passing out, this might hit the spot for you. Otherwise, I\'d skip this. It\'s definitely not worth paying for.'),(1114,67,'4/10','A sequel we could live without','BigGuy','1 June 2024','I enjoyed the first Die Hart movie. It wasn\'t amazing but it was enjoyable and had some original bits. This was not as good.

It plunged into the tense drama. This erratic genre-hopping resulted in a story that lacked direction and coherence.\n\nIt\'s possible that the erratic pacing and tone were due to the director\'s inability to harness the film\'s dynamic. However, the writing also played a part in the film\'s shortcomings. The humor often missed the mark, the plot developments seemed contrived, and the storyline progressed awkwardly. The performances, while earnest, were unable to transcend the script\'s limitations.\n\nIn all honesty, this movie falls short of being a worthwhile watch, even as a last-ditch option.

This trend may contribute to the declining standards of film quality and the drop in cinema ticket sales.

After all, action and tension is what Independence Day wants to deliver. It is not about complexity as his artistic expression resides in entertainment','fernandoschiavi','10 April 2021','Roland Emmerich is, without a doubt, the Master of the catastrophe films. On his resume, the director not only has Independence Day, his first dive into the sub-genre, but also Godzilla, The Day After Tomorrow, and 2012, all marked by mass destruction - global most of the time - and a complete absence script or quality performances, absences that open the way for the visual spectacle in computer graphics with several memorable sequences. Here, Independence Day literally encapsulates the spirit of all those similar films from the 70s such as the series Airport, Earthquake, Hell in the Tower, Poseidon\'s Destiny, copying almost entirely from the classic formula, which usually addresses family nuclei or friends before the tragedy in a slow narrative construction and the consequences after the apocalypse sets in. And there\'s nothing wrong with that, actually, as Emmerich lends his ability to create epics - Stargate was his immediately preceding film, which already demonstrated his ability to handle science fiction well - and creates a film that will be guaranteed fun. Just ignore the various poetic licenses in the script and embark on the guilt-free adventure.\n\nWith an estimated budget of 75 million, Independence Day stifled Spielberg\'s intentions to remake the classic 1953 War of the Worlds to present an alien invasion on an absurd scale. Since the first teaser trailers, with the shadows consuming tourist spots accompanied by the expression of astonishment from passers-by, the feature film has already come with the proposal to shape America\'s basic formula of self-destruction: if terrorists could not find access - until then - , a flurry of blockbusters began that featured the United States being threatened by natural phenomena and alien forces. As a masochistic pleasure intensified by the approach of the end of the millennium, the result could not be other than a lot of destruction, with sensational effects from impressive models, and the exaggerated patriotism, capable of putting the American president himself on a fighter to face the enemies. Interplanetary.\n\nDon\'t ask how, but even though the United States government communicates with other nations through Morse code, television continues to quietly broadcast the news with naughty information to the viewer - commonly, us - and that\'s even after the attacks. It doesn\'t help the spectator to wonder how David managed, in less than six hours, to pick up his father, get out of downtown New York faster than the whole crowd, and still arrive in Washington, about 330 kilometers from distance; And why bother with the fact that aliens, coming from beyond the solar system, count time in the same measurements as we do? After all, who cares? Forget it, after all, we are back in 1996, a time when the characters use gigantic cell phones, while the aliens have a touchscreen.\n\nRegarding the script of the film, it is fair to say that it is the factor most detonated by the specialized critic. The focus of the production really is to bring elaborate scenes of destruction, leaving the likelihood in the background. There is a lot of patriotism to the United States, to its July 4th holiday (which becomes a world holiday) and to the American army. The script also does not seek to deepen the personal dramas of the characters and some situations are quite fanciful. But the truth is that this was never the intention. Director Roland Emmerich sucks at character development - it would be prudent to say that he may not know what that actually means - but, on the other hand, he is efficient in his action sequences. And since they tend to put the protagonists and large crowds of people in danger, it is easy to gain public empathy, since we on this side of the screen prefer to think that, instead of those figures, we would also survive - right? Big explosion and collapse of a tunnel? No problem, you would go through this to drive a truck and save the First Lady of the United States. Drag the body of an extraterrestrial across the desert, even without supplies? Of course, if you, like Will Smith, can punch one of the damn aliens right in the face. Escape from a colossal explosion at the last second by just a few feet with Air Force One? Only if we can get rid of an even bigger explosion, in space and on board an alien spaceship. Emmerich may not take the human side of his characters very much into consideration, but he is great at instigating the superhuman in them, which hits our ego right in the middle - after all, if they succeed, why not me?\n\nIf, on the one hand, the narrative is poor, Independence Day stands out in the technical part. David Arnold\'s great soundtrack, simply contagious, manages to electrify in the intense scenes and manages to thrill in those more dramatic scenes, as in a moment when an important character dies. The composer manages to bring a track with melodies that help and a lot to give the mood of the film. The editing of sound effects and sound mixing mixes well the noise of explosions, the shouting of people, the shooting of ships and falling buildings. It is no coincidence that he competed for the Oscar for Best Sound.\n\nThe general shots taken by Karl Walter Lindenlaub, which Emmerich brought from Stargate, work very well to convey the magnitude of the attacks. David Brenner\'s montage (The Day After Tomorrow, 2012, The Man of Steel) also deserves commendation for not succumbing to the spectator\'s bewilderment. Using Lindenlaub\'s broader photograph very well, he connects the sequences in a way that makes the beating - even in the complicated final aerial attack - logical without losing its energy. And what about the visual effects, which won the Oscars? Today they may seem a little dated, but nothing that gets in the way. And when reviewing the film today, it is actually impressive that many scenes remain current. The grandeur of the ships, the destruction of buildings and the White House, the final air battles, everything remains exciting.\n\nThe film is shallow and somewhat empty of content - the theme \"union of nations\" is beautiful, but if we squeeze it, nothing comes out - but it is undeniable that the director and his script partner Dean Devlin manage to create captivating characters, who they carry the film on their backs. Will Smith in his first big hit, in his burst stage. The star has always lavished charisma, mainly for his comical crazy things and in the action scenes. The best jokes and jokes come out of Smith\'s mouth. The star Jeff Goldblum (from \'The Fly\" and \'Jurassic Park\') always with presence and a restrained performance. Bill Pullman plays with respect a well-intentioned and convincing president. Veterans Randy Quaid and Judd Hirsch are surprisingly funny. The synchrony of all of them is something that helps us to care about the characters and cheer in the end.\n\nIndependence Day is a beautiful example of the catastrophe film, almost a return to the seventies past, which seems to have been the decade that \"created\" the genre. This work by Emmerich will remain in the viewer\'s memory even if it is due to its exaggeration and absurd technological freedoms. A true guilty pleasure, of those who leave a pleasant smile on the face after the projection. It\'s another great guilty pleasure - that movie, which is essentially pretty bad, but you have fun watching it - directed by the filmmaker specializing in catastrophe films. After all, action and tension is what Emmerich wants to deliver. It is not about his \"sophisticated and complex\" plot that he wants to base his feature film on, as his artistic expression resides in entertainment. Who cares about ufanism - I would say implicitly, if the foreground was not an American flag - and cheesy melodramas when Bill Pullman is giving such an \"inspirational\" speech? Anyway, they say that there is that kind of film to \"turn off the brain\". I say that for this we have those we can call \"bad\". Independence Day is not to turn anything off, but rather just one of those event films that requires less from the intellect of others - which is different, and by no means a demerit. After all, features like these by Emmerich, however disposable they may be, will always find shelter.'),(1138,68,'7/10','Look at the size of that thing','ExpendableMan','2 September 2007','Independence Day is the sort of film that\'s best appreciated on a big screen, preferably a massive great plasma television that is so huge you had to cut the roof off your house and get airlifted in by helicopters just to get it in the living room. You should also have the most state of the art surround sound possible, with bass pickups so deep they cause earthquakes on the Eastern seaboard. Not because Dean Devlin and Roland Emmerich\'s alien invasion flick is a masterpiece of cinematic art or anything, but because it\'s loud. Very loud. And if the windows in your house don\'t shatter when the spaceship flies over New York then well, you\'re just not experiencing it properly.\n\nTaking the 1950\'s invasion narratives and pro-tooling them for 90\'s audiences, Independence Day is an absolute blast of visual flare and gung ho heroism. The plot is so straightforward as to be superfluous (aliens invade, fights ensue) but even so, it remains an invigorating watch purely because of the spectacle it provides. Back in 1996, the sight of that giant blue laser tearing apart lower Manhattan made jaws drop and while it\'s unlikely to do the same to today\'s overstimulated audiences, it\'s still an incredible visual feast. What\'s more, the ensemble cast makes it surprisingly unpredictable - we all know that the aliens will be defeated at the end, but what isn\'t so obvious is which characters are going to be alive to see it. Except for the kid and the dog. They\'re relatively safe bets.\n\nWatching it now though, it does possess a cheerful naivety in the face of world politics. After all, this was 1996, the Cold War was over and 9/11 a long way off, so the entire world uniting against a common foe without being bogged down with petty arguments and personal agendas still seemed believable. Hell, even the gun-toting Arabs that briefly appear on screen are more than happy to rally behind Uncle Sam in the name of freedom. That\'s right folks, it\'s an Americans Save The World movie, complete with a snapshot of British officers drinking tea in the desert and waiting for those silly yanks to get a bally move on and show us what to do.\n\nNeedless to say, this is blockbuster entertainment through and through. The aliens are apparently here to strip mine the planet of all her natural resources, but they\'re quite happy to put that off for a bit in order to blow things up for the entire running time. Fans of in-depth characterisation, intelligent story telling and emotional engagement with the protagonists are wasting their time, but if you want to watch tourist attractions, jet planes and space craft exploding for three hours, you can\'t really go wrong. That business about a computer virus bringing down the mother-ship is a bit daft though, not once did they try switching everything on and off again.'),(1139,68,'7/10','Great popcorn flick','Analog_Devotee','11 January 2021','Turn your brain off and just enjoy it.

Seems like this one was a guilty-pleasure classic from opening day. ID4 isn\'t well-written and constantly bathes itself in dense layers of cheese, but it tries hard, most the character arcs connect and the big special effects hold up quite well, despite their age.\n\nFor a movie that\'s so thoroughly reliant on spectacle, that last point is pretty important. The power of watching the White House or Empire State Building burst into a billion bitty pieces is still there, irresistible, while the magnitude of the invading fleet remains immense, and I think both can be attributed to the production\'s choice to eschew then-new CG techniques in favor of a large, intricately detailed stable of miniatures. We get a few hiccups, like the obviously green-screened fighter jets or the absurd visual of a golden retriever leaping to slow-motion safety through a fiery inferno, but for the most part it all looks great and it\'s still easy to get sucked into the experience.\n\nOf course, the whole thing is over-acted to death. Roland Emmerich has never been one to bring out nuance from his cast, and this is an awfully shallow effort, even by his standards. Bill Pullman nails the big motivational speech, set to a telegraphed swell of patriotic symphony, but otherwise lacks conviction as a limp, reactive PotUS. Randy Quaid is a cheap xerox of every alien abduction stereotype to ever enter pop culture. Jeff Goldblum is naturally quirky enough to make his role worthwhile, but it takes every bit of his innate charismatic magnetism to overcome the dumb plot developments. Will Smith is the only unequivocal success, barking and fist-pumping his way to bonafide action hero status in a simple but essential role as a beefy marine / pure force of will.\n\nFrom a critical perspective, this is cinematic junk food. Big bangs and shiny lights to dazzle the box office crowd, with a few easy jokes to lighten the mood. But yet, there\'s something else to it, something essential and inexplicable. It\'s just raw, simple fun, I suppose, that makes no apologies for how it acts or what it aims to be.

What were they expecting? A remake of 2001: A Space Odyssey. Sure, I am not going to pretend the film does not has many glaring weaknesses. The plot is hardly original; its execution is even less inspiring. Roland Emmerich goes out of his way to use every cliche in the book, over-sentimentality, weak, flat characterizations, incredible jumps in logic and reasoning made on the viewer, and the use of special effects to overcome these shortcomings. But what some of the reviewers seemed to have missed, and its there as substantiated by the huge popularity of the film, is heart. The film has a lot of heart. It makes you feel good after watching it. And although that quality does not make it a great film, it certainly makes it a good film in my book. The film is vastly entertaining, very suspenseful, a delight for the eyes with dazzling special effects, and even has some dialogue that does just rise above its hackneyed origins. The acting is adequate all around with no one pulling off a great performance, but a few doing marvelous jobs with what they have to work with. Judd Hirsch easily out acts his fellow colleagues as a Jewish father with a gift for common sense and lack of tact. Jeff Goldblum also gives a pretty good performance as his son. Yeah, Will Smith is just Will Smith..lots of one liners and little meat so to speak. But he is bearable. Watch for Brent Spiner in an outrageous role as a hippie scientist. His performance is a real hoot! If you are looking for philosophical science fiction, this is not it. See Starship Troopers(a great film).

Will Smith, with a movie career underway, is excellent. Bill Pullman is great as the President. The effects were amazing especially when the buildings were blown up.

A lot of critics don\'t like this one and a lot of people who think of themselves as critics don\'t care much for it either, but it still brought in over 300 million at the box office in the summer of 96. I thought it was an entertaining film with lots of action and a good dose of comedy as well. One complaint I have is that it runs a bit long and you feel the time pass not like other movies like \"The Two Towers\" where it doesn\'t feel like all that much time has passed. Another problem with this movie is that it is best seen in the theater. This movie has a score of only six at imdb, so a lot of people who saw it probably saw it on TV. Or if they did see it at the theaters, realized it just wasn\'t as good on the small screen when they saw it on TV. The movie also benefited from a great ad campaign that started with a super bowl spot that showed the White House being destroyed. The movie is basically an alien invasion movie and it is like a 50\'s science fiction movie. It also has a lot of stars, not the biggest names, just like a 70\'s disaster flick. If you don\'t care for either of these genres you probably won\'t like this movie, but if you like one or the other or both it is worth checking out.

Clarke wasn\'t given a nod for the idea of the scene seems to have come directly from \'Childhood\'s End\'. I haven\'t read all the reviews, but it seems some points have not been addressed; for example, world unity. The world is so divided by ideologies, language, beliefs, economic conditions, currency, etc. that it would take a world-wide threat (like an alien attack or another black plague) to unify all the people. This film, shallow as it is in other respects, illustrates that. Also, this film was \'centered\' in America, so the film makers naturally concentrated on America, with \'cameos\' of members of other countries. I resent being told that \'the worst part of the movie was America\' (see above comment about divisiveness, negativism and just plain rudeness). Obviously, I am American, but I have Swedish and English (and other) roots. I consider myself a citizen of Earth. The Earth, this little blue planet is my home. So, let\'s try to take that phrase \'think globally\' seriously.

It is basically a millenial version of The War of the Worlds with grand-scale effects and a cast which probably cost almost as much as the effects. Will Smith, Randy Quaid, Jeff Goldblum, Adam Baldwin and Judd Hirsch help pick up a surprisingly talented (but underexploited) cast and seem to have enjoyed their parts. Unfortunately, the mediocre script allowed few of the other actors to make their roles shine.\n\nThe plot is so simple it\'s hard to imagine a 140+ minute film about it. The earth is under invasion from a highly advanced and merciless alien culture hell bent on intergalactic conquest. Our most powerful weapons can not pierce their shields and their weapons are capable of incinerating cities the size of Washington DC with one shot. After the first wave of attacks, all seems lost, and humans must find some way to fight back.\n\nRoland Emmerich\'s direction is good. There are few dull moments and very little in the way of uninteresting and pointless scenes. Unfortunately, the characters are generally two-dimensional - even Bill Pullman\'s brooding, depressed President of the United States comes across as an uncomplicated, uninspired and unemotional individual. Limited character development and an uncomplicated plot result in a one-shot movie.\n\nThe best performances in Independence Day are the semi-comedic ones (note the actors mentioned above.

A recurring derogatory comment was \"The Americans save the day, again.\" And the movie is \"only for stupid American children and rednecks.\"\n\nI don\'t understand what those people are thinking about. This is an American movie, made for, oddly enough, Americans! Would those people also be surprised that Americans are biased for America? I personally agree that the RAH-RAH factor was too high in ID4, but not all my countrymen must have felt that way. The movie made over $300,000,000 domestically, so more than kids and hicks must have liked it. And despite the fact that, overseas, the IMDb commenter\'s seem to dismiss the film as propagandistic pabulum, it made almost $500,000,000 in foreign sales, so there must be a lot of American rednecks in other countries too.\n\nNow, if foreigners want to watch American films, that\'s fine with me (and I\'m sure it\'s more than fine with U.S. movie producers), but they shouldn\'t be surprised if our movies are \"Pro-American.\" I would expect that Russian films are \"Pro-Russian\" too.\n\nIf anyone is offended by our films, the solution is really simple - DON\'T WATCH THEM. I found French films to be pretentious, low rent, chick flicks, so I stopped watching them. Not watching foreign films is easy to do, so feel free to show your disgust by never watching an American film again. In fact, if all foreigners stopped, maybe Hollywood studios would start making films just for them, although you shouldn\'t hold your breath.\n\nIf Germany, Japan, or any other country could make such big, booming, over-the-top films, I\'d probably watch them, but no other countries have production companies that can afford to throw a hundred million dollars (or more) into making a film. If you want wiz-bang, high-tech, blockbuster films like Harry Potter, Terminator 2, Spiderman, Star Wars, Jurassic Park, The Matrix, Raiders Of The Lost Ark, ID4, etc., you\'re going to have to view an American film. And if they have to put some patriotic RAH-RAH in there to make sure they at least make their money back domestically (in case the film doesn\'t work overseas), well, that\'s what they\'ll do. Movie making is just a business like any other. If movies don\'t make money, they\'ll stop making them.\n\nRemember- Movies like ID4 and X-Men are just mindless FANTASIES.

Emmerich\'s direction keeps the adrenaline pumping, ensuring that the film never loses its momentum. From the get-go, viewers are treated to a spectacle of epic proportions as humanity faces an alien threat, making Independence Day a joyous celebration of cinematic entertainment.\n\nWhat sets Independence Day apart is its groundbreaking visual effects, especially considering the era of its release.

The sheer scale of destruction and chaos caused by the alien invaders is both awe-inspiring and a testament to the film\'s commitment to delivering a cinematic spectacle.\n\nThe ensemble cast, led by the charismatic trio of Will Smith, Jeff Goldblum, and Bill Pullman, injects a tremendous amount of fun into the movie. Will Smith\'s infectious energy as Captain Steven Hiller, Jeff Goldblum\'s witty portrayal of David Levinson, and Bill Pullman\'s rousing speech as President Thomas J.

Its perfect 10/10 rating is well-deserved for its exhilarating action, groundbreaking visuals, and the sheer fun it brings to the screen.

The movie had great visual effects (maybe not so good nowadays but this was made in the 90s) and great storyline.

However, Independence Day is one of the few with some merits. It is also the best film to-date by German sci-fi/action director Roland Emmerich. The greatest flaw of Indepence Day (aka ID4 due to initial copyright problems with the Independence Day title) is the excessive jingoism. Completely America centric, it seems that the rest of human civilization is helpless without the Yanks. The American President is not just the only world leader fighting for a free world, he even moonlights as a fighter pilot attacking the aliens.\n\nHowever, its still a damn entertaining film.

Not to mention spice, the book has huge dialogue said in the characters minds. Well the simple answer is u can\'t do justice to the source material with this runtime.\n\nBut for all the faults this film as I remember back in the day being passed to me via a VHS recording off TV some of us still remember those days I was blown away I had never seen anything like it as a teenager the sets the costumes the visuals, the action, just strangeness of it all and that opening score wow, got me to read the novels and what novels they are each one different from the other with profound statements on what a hero is, and if you haven\'t read Dune you will certainly be confused by the sheer mass of strange names and fast moving plot. Was David lynch the wrong captain to steer this ship?, I\'m not too sure he greatly respected the source material and wanted final cut making a three hour plus movie but the studio wanted a 2 hour star wars clone and Dune is nothing like Star wars although there are minor aspects George Lucas might of been influenced from for his famous space opera.\n\nOne will either be confused by the complex plot or intrigued to search out Frank Herberts masterpiece of a novel.\n\nThen there\'s the cast easily as good as the modern version and in some respects more faithful to the book. A miss fire of adapting the source due to the length but if David lynch was given a 5 hour runtime I shudder to think he might of just of nailed it. But the better version of Frank Herberts novel is adapted to the screen is the 2001 Denis Villeneuve part one and the much anticipated part 2 with reference to length both will clock in together around the 5 hour mark.'),(1161,69,'7/10','Dune\'s Devil in David\'s Details','mstomaso','9 April 2007','My review covers both versions of Dune, the 2 hour release and the extended 3 hour \"Smithee\" version aired on television. The first cut of the film was over four hours long, but there was never any intention to release this, and Lynch himself shot scenes which consolidated the final product into a more manageable length.\n\nAllen Smithee, a protest pseudonym adopted by Lynch when he disassociated himself with the 3 hour version of this film, is also alluded to in Lynch\'s latest film - Inland Empire. A portion of a film studio in Inland Empire is \"Smithee\'s Room\" - a metaphorical insight into Lynch\'s feelings about Dune, and studio-controlled film-making in general.\n\nGiven the tremendous investment made by the studio, Lynch\'s general distaste for the final product, the repetitive cliché soundtrack, and the occasionally bizarre use of voice-over narrative in the TV version, it seems more a DeLaurentis film than a Lynch film. Although I am very interested in Lynch\'s films and other projects, I am evaluating this solely from my own perspective. Despite the great director\'s poor opinion of this film, I enjoyed it and it is one of my favorite sci-fi films.\n\nFrank Herbert, author of the novel upon which it is based, approved the theatrical version, but he had the benefit of knowing what he was going to see. If you haven\'t read the book, these films can be somewhat difficult to understand. And if you come to the experience expecting something like Star Wars, you should probably find something else to do.\n\nThe soundtrack is repetitive and only interesting the first time you hear the film\'s major theme (the Eno composition). The use of rock orchestration simply does not work in this film. Happily, Lynch learned from the experience and used rock instrumentation beautifully in later films (especially Wild at Heart and Lost Highway). The camera work is generally less inspired than the rest of Lynch\'s portfolio. There are occasional visually striking scenes which will remind you of the film\'s origin, but there are too many static shots - especially during the action scenes. The soundtrack is easy to explain - like the inclusion of Sting in the cast - this is a marketing move by the production company, not a creative choice of the director. The camera work is much less easily explained. Perhaps Lynch was asked to avoid doing anything surreal or bizarre with this film (sort of like asking Groucho Marx to avoid being funny), or the studio was trying to appeal to fans of Star Wars by simplifying and sterilizing its story.\n\nThe recently released special edition DVD reveals some very interesting aspects of the production. Lynch\'s influence, not surprisingly, is best explored in the short documentary concerning the film\'s design. As an artist, Lynch spent a great deal of time and energy envisioning the material culture  both historical and modern  of each culture depicted in the film, helping to create a consistent and unique characterization for each. This spilled over quite naturally into costume design. The sets and costumes used in this film are really spectacular. The special effects, often derided by contemporary viewers, required a great deal more effort that the synthetic art of today\'s computerized extravaganzas and, the documentary concerning their production on the DVD is also appropriately respectful.\n\nWhat you will see is an intense visualization of several, fully realized alien cultures whose art, architecture and general heritage are as well realized, if not more so, than in Herbert\'s epic novel. To fully appreciate this, don\'t just check out the extras on the DVD, turn down the sound and just watch the sets, costumes, and effects move through each scenes. There is, as with Lynch\'s entire portfolio, a great deal to be seen. And the acting and direction are fine throughout the film.\n\nThe longer version fleshes out the stories, themes and intricate subplots of Herbert\'s book more thoroughly, and maintains a much steadier pace than the cinematic release. Even so, both films, to some extent, suffer from too much story, overwhelming visualization, and a un-Lynchian frenetic pace. The later TV mini-series by the sci fi channel does a better job of telling the story in its entirety, but runs about 246 minutes and does not compare to the original in terms of design. Lynch\'s cinematic release, by contrast, rushes through components of the book and often feels inconsistent in pace.\n\nPLOT: Dune is the story of Paul \"Muad\'ib\" Atreides, the son of Duke Leto Atreides the Just and his Bene Jesserat concubine Lady Jessica. Combining aspects of fantasy, sci-fi and anthropology, the story follows young Paul through a series of tragedies which find him seeking redemption for an entire galaxy by leading an adoptive tribal culture to a revolutionary cleansing of the malignant imperial system from which he sprung. The plot is exceedingly complex  in both Lynch versions of the film much is left out of Herbert\'s original work. Subplots abound, but, true to form, Lynch avoids short-cuts as much as possible and attempts to show his audience what is going on rather than resorting to a great deal of voice-over narrative in the theatrical release. The TV version, however, attempts to provide even more detail, and uses voice-over to patch up the areas glossed over by Lynch\'s script.\n\nSUMMARY: If you\'re a Lynch fan and not a big Herbert fan or you don\'t have a great deal of patience, see the cinematic release. It is the class of the lot.\n\nIf you haven\'t read the book, or you are a Herbert purist who will accept only what was written, choose the Sci-Fi Channel version (review forthcoming soon) - but be forewarned - it is very long.\n\nIf you want something that compromises between story and cinematic artistry, go for the TV version.

After having watched it several times over the years, I\'m not afraid to call it a very flawed classic. That sounds strange, but it fits for this movie. Lynch got so many things right, but in the end the shortcomings of trying to squeeze an epic story into a little over 2 hours was simply too daunting a challenge. Besides, I\'m sure many went into the theatre expecting a film in the vein of STAR WARS.\n\nDUNE is not a story with which one can delve into brainless. It does require thought, for it\'s inaccurate to portray it as anything less than a thinking person\'s story. It\'s not space battles, laser-gun shootouts, funny aliens, etc. There\'s nothing wrong with those things, it\'s just not what DUNE is about. It touches on everything from politics, religion, ecology, the true power of the human mind and will when fully realized, God, etc. Some heady stuff.\n\nSo imagine trying to fit all that in a movie.\n\nLynch got the feel, the imagery down, but wasn\'t able to cohesively bring the story around w/o really making it a Cliff Notes version of the story. You get the main gist, but don\'t get the \"full story\", the themes, etc. So in the end it does disappoint because you\'re left wondering what may have been had the movie conventions of that time allowed for a 2 or even 3 movie epic. Oh wait, STAR WARS did that. I guess DUNE wasn\'t viewed as bankable enough to make such an investment.\n\nAnyway, I still like the film a lot. The visual realization by Lynch makes it a classic in my book, too bad it couldn\'t be matched by an equally strong script. I wonder if Peter Jackson would be willing to tackle another 3 film epic?

R. R. Tolkien, only instead of a sweeping fantasy epic, it\'s a sci-fi epic. It\'s also considered to be one of the hardest books to adapt into movie format (not that people haven\'t tried before and after this adaptation), probably because of its dense narrative and the multitude of characters and organizations in it, not to mention that the book has also multiple sequels that greatly expand the expansive universe already established in the initial novel.\n\nThe David Lynch adaptation of Frank Herbert\'s novel is, as I state in the headline, perhaps one of the most divisive book adaptations ever made. Many diehard fans of Herbert\'s novel dislike the movie, and many of Lynch\'s fans consider it to be either a success or a failure. So what do I think of it?\n\nWell, after watching the SyFy channel\'s miniseries adaptation, reading the actual book, and watching Denis Villeneuve\'s adaptation, I would say Lynch\'s adaptation is both a success and a failure at various points.\n\nThe casting is pretty well-done for the film, though Kyle MacLachen is kind of wooden as Paul Atreides compared to Kyle Newman\'s and Timothee Chalamet\'s performances in the other Dune productions. It\'s the rest of the cast that shines. Jurgen Prochnow, Max von Sydow, Kenneth McMillian, Jose Ferrer, Freddie Jones, Francesca Annis, Sian Phillips, Alicia Witt, Sean Young, Brad Dourif, and Patrick Stewart and everyone else plays their roles to the hilt, though in the final fifty minutes of the extended cut the cast kind of starts acting over-dramatically. Some of the actors are also woefully underused, like Sting as Feyd Rautha Harkonnen and Virginia Madsen as the Princess Irulan Corrino, while certain characters from the book, most notably the Fenrings, are either composited or omitted entirely.\n\nThe script to the movie is the problem. Basically, the extended cut is a three hour film that devotes about ninety percent of the story to the first third of the Novel, then speeds through the other two thirds in less than fifty minutes. The narrative is unbalanced in other words.\n\nHowever, for a mostly three-hour film, it\'s still pretty good, despite the rushed and over-dramatic final act. While the special effects are not the best in comparison to other 80s sci-fi and the sandworms look like a mobile version of the Sarlacc monster from \'Return of the Jedi\', the sets are quite impressive and the costume design is excellent. Also, the score by rock band Toto is actually just as iconic as the Star Wars theme by John Williams and is much easier to remember than Hans Zimmer\'s techno-thudding-and-beating for Villeneuve\'s Dune.\n\nAll in all, If you can find it, I recommend finding the extended cut of Lynch\'s Dune on DVD. It\'s a worthwhile addition to any sci-fi nerd\'s collection, despite the divided opinions of it.'),(1164,69,'6/10','An odd film that would have worked better as a trilogy','lopresti-46927','6 August 2020','Dune is very interesting, if not downright odd.

The production value (camera angles, special effects sets, costumes, etc.) is generally good for the time period. Some of the costumes are unintentionally comical and weird but that is what gives this movie its charm. Generally the acting wasn\'t great, besides the main protagonists.

The emperor plans to dethrone Duke Leto Atreides (Jürgen Prochnow) fearing his new weapon, the weirding module. First he allows the House Atreides to run the spice production. Then he supports the jealous House Harkonnen to invade and kill all the Atreides. There is something about Paul Atreides (Kyle MacLachlan) that concerns everybody. He and his mother Lady Jessica manage to escape the massacre. They find shelter with the Fremen as he falls in love with Chani (Sean Young).\n\nThere is a dense introduction and lots of expositions. It is way too complicated for novices on the first try. I\'m sure many people glazed over. The style is impressive. It has a great unique look. The production value is all there on the screen. The cast is also impressive with some strange outsider casting like Sting, a whole lot of experience, and some newcomers who would become big stars. They all work in their own way. David Lynch is definitely going all in with this movie. It has its Lynch weirdness but he holds it back enough to allow the story to make some sense. The weirdness sometimes works but sometimes pumps up the cheese factor. It just won\'t make sense to most people who haven\'t read the books.

The main score is generally excellent (except when it pointlessly switches to dated \'80\'s guitar rock), some of the images of the endless deserts of Arrakis are quite well done, and, although primitive and simplistic by modern standards, the early use of CGI in the shielded fight scenes should be lauded. Unfortunately these plusses are greatly outweighed by the film\'s deficits. The producers seemed to have little faith in the actors, so almost every action is accompanied by an explanatory voice representing of the person\'s thoughts. Some of the acting, especially the various villainous Harkonnens, is awful. The novelty-casting of Sting as Feyd-Rautha doesn\'t help: he spends too much time trying to look evil by smirking and fiddling with a knife but whatever menace he establishes is quickly undone when he steps out of the steam-bath in leather pampers. Kyle MacLachlan, who plays the central character Paul Atreides, generally looks uncomfortable and out of place, which is not helped by the constant melodramatic voiceovers. Patrick Stewart\'s Gurney Halleck is good (although why he has to carry the little dog is beyond me), as is Max von Sydow who plays Kynes, the exobiologist and honorary Freman who introduces Paul to the desert planet. The special-effects set pieces (especially the sand-worms and the climactic battle) have not aged well and despite some nice \'steam punk\' stylings, the film still looks like an overproduced 1980\'s Italian vision of the future. Lynch has essentially disowned the film as have many fans of the book. I didn\'t like \"Dune\" when I first saw it 34 years ago and a recent rewatch on Netflix didn\'t do much to change my overall opinion.

It took nigh-endless resources from Dino de Laurentiis to complete Lynch\'s version.\n\nThe problems with David Lynch\'s Dune are many. The characters, beyond Paul, are all but undeveloped--for instance, Harkonnen is simply a grotesque figure, not a great political rival for the Atreides. Similarly, much of the plot is simply a checklist of important scenes from the movie, cheapening Paul\'s internal struggles with what he is, and ruining the thematic impact of the film. Lynch\'s storytelling is horrible--relying on character thought and exposition to tell things better shown. And Lynch\'s own additions are abysmal--such as the contrived weirding modules. No one and nothing is shown in the depth it acquires in the book.\n\nThe final problems are incredible. One, Paul is clearly shown as a good-guy superhero, not a man of amazing power both spiritually and temporally, who is in questionable moral ground. Second, it rains at the end.

To keep it short the 137 version is great and the 190 min version sucks.\n\nThe TV version was split up to fill 2 evenings. For that they added about an hour of additional material not seen in the original version. While some of it is quite good like the prologue which went a little bit deeper into the Dune universe (Butlers Djihad) but most of it just destroys the atmosphere and the flow of the movie. On the technical side there is to note that the whole movie was Pan-Scanned which never is a good idea. Compared to the original version the quality really blows.\n\nNow to the good one:\n\nThe movie is pretty much faithful to the book. There are things that were cut out from the book or it shows stuff that wasn\'t there, but what you see is CLEARLY Herbert\'s book which I thought is nearly impossible to translate into a (good) movie. It translates the \"feel\" of the book very well to the screen.\n\nThe most notable differences is that in the book Paul is at the age of 15 (at least at the beginning) while McLachlan more looks like 20 but I can live with that. The rest are minor things (like these sound modules) and some differences in continuity (the navigators needing the spice to well... navigate is revealed at the beginning).\n\nThe all actors give a solid performances.

Despite being butchered by the studios, with almost half of its runtime excised, this sprawling, ambitious epic still manages to make a mark. From the get-go, I was drawn in by the creative designs and visuals that transport you to the distant future. The sandworms alone are worth the price of admission!\n\nThe performances in Dune are another highlight. While some characters feel a bit underdeveloped due to the shortened runtime, the cast delivers strong performances that keep you engaged. I found myself particularly impressed by Sting. His deliciously over the top turn delivers entertainment value in spades.\n\nOne thing that stood out to me was the pacing. Owing to the condensed runtime, Dune manages to keep the story moving at a decent pace. There are moments of excitement and intrigue interspersed with quieter, more reflective scenes that allow you to catch your breath.\n\nOf course, Dune isn\'t without its flaws. The truncated runtime means that many plot points feel rushed, and certain characters don\'t get the development they deserve. Additionally, the film\'s dense mythology may be off-putting to those unfamiliar with the source material, confounded further by plot leaps courtesy of an overly judicious editor\'s knife. Due credit must be given to David Lynch though. His tenacity in attempting such a project is worthy of recognition.\n\nOverall, I\'d say Dune is a middling but slightly positive experience.

So I went to see it and came away convinced that I has just seen the worst big-budget film of all time. Its crippling handicap was the quality of the screen writing. As I watched it, I tried to relate the portrayed characters to their counterparts in the book and found that I could not recognise a single one. I wondered if David Lynch had actually read the book before he wrote the screenplay.\n\nThe acting was dreadful and the dialogue was worse. I have seen most of the cast in other films where they were actually permitted to act, which is just as well, or I would have grown up thinking that they were all overblown, second-rate hams. The biggest piece of mis-casting was to have Patrick Stewart play Gurney Halleck - he deserved much better than that and I hope he didn\'t spend too long regretting accepting this role. Choosing another at random: Everitt McGill as Stilgar was less than memorable, not being allowed to act, but simply progressing from one sonorous pronouncement to the next.\n\nThe sets were brilliant - I have no quarrel with that part of the film - but imaginative backdrops alone cannot bolster a production where the quality of the script and acting - or rather, the direction - fell so dismally short of any acceptable standard.\n\nThe costumes were also very well done, with one notable, and very important exception: Lynch clearly forgot most of what he had read in the book when he approved the final design of the Fremen stillsuits.\n\nOn occasion, over the intervening twenty-odd years, when I have thought about this unrelentingly awful film, it has been more in regret than anger. Despite this, I never really gave up on it and, four months ago, when I found the three-hour extended version, at a price that made it worth the effort, I bought it in the hope that some extra added footage might give the wretched thing some credibility.\n\nIt was a forlorn hope. This extended version is an even bigger train wreck than the original theatrical release, and was clearly re-worked for television - it is easy to spot the blanks for the commercial break cues. The editing is quite incompetent and added scenes that have no context in the story line at the place where they were inserted - for example, one repeated scene showed the same Harkonnen ship approaching the landing field at Arrakeen. Another piece of sloppy editing early in the film had Reverend Mother Helen Gaius Mohaim being transported to Caladan, the home world of House Atriedes, by the same two Harkonnen pilots that took Jessica and Paul into the deep desert on Dune, after the Harkonnen attack.\n\nThere was one particular, poignant part of the novel that both versions of the film left hanging, and which deserved to be included. That was the death of Thufir Hawat, at the end, after the Imperial forces had surrendered to Duke Paul Atreides. In the film, this life-long servant of House Atreides was left standing among the Imperial captives, gazing vacantly at the ceiling, suffering from the terminal effects of the residual poison that the Harkonnens had infected him with after they captured him on Dune and subverted him to their own service. In the book, however, the dying Hawat was given a poisoned needle by Emperor Shaddam and Reverend Mother Mohaiam and ordered to assassinate Paul, this \'upstart Duke\', when he stood before him. Hawat disobeyed, and as he he stood before Paul, he turned to the Emperor in a magnificent gesture, holding out his hand with the needle in its palm and said, \"See, Majesty? See your traitor\'s needle?

Swish orange juice, toothpaste, and clam chowder in your mouth: you\'ll get the same effect.\n\nHerbert wrote an epic masterpiece that should be regarded as the Hamlet of science fiction (actually, it is very vaguely adapted from Hamlet). David Lynch scripted and directed a butchery of this novel. He made so many mistakes, it is impossible to cover them all. Here\'s a general idea: the novel is summarized, not adapted. The movie contains about half of the elements involved in the story, and watching it makes you feel like you\'re falling asleep and missing half the plot. Everybody in the story has an agenda, but you get to see only half of these agendas, and are left to imagine the others. Character development was mediocre, and paled in comparison to the rich depth given in the novel. The writers obviously did not understand Herbert\'s technologies, because the movie displayed loads of horse dung where there should have been intricacies that would say, \"Star Wars, eat your heart out.\" There was poor acting from everybody but Jurgen Prochnow as Leto, Patrick Stewart as Halleck, and Sting as Rautha. And finally, the special effects of the time simply weren\'t up to snuff for Herbert\'s vision. From the blue eyes to the force fields, everything looked horribly cheesy. If the folks had waited a decade, or maybe used something better than a third-grader\'s sketch pad, then they would have had stunning visual effects.\n\nOverall, what we are left with here is a definitive flop. I can only hope that the TV miniseries version that aired last year did a better job. On a scale of 1 to 10, this movie is somewhere around absolute zero (-273.15, FYI).'),(1179,69,'9/10','Why does Lynch hate this one?','Starbuck-13','15 April 1999','To begin with, I have to say that I saw the movie first, and read the book years later. This seems to be important: Nearly everybody who read the book first hates the movie, but most of those who saw the movie first seem to like it.\n\nNow, why is this so? I cannot really understand it because, in comparition to other movies based on existing literature, what we have here is a film which stays very close to the original story and does not add many new elements.\n\nWhen I read the book, I could see the movie in front of me in nearly every chapter. So I really don\'t understand what Herbert-Fans had expected from this movie...\n\nI for my part like it a lot. It has a very mystical atmosphere about it and the story develops nicely. Of course there are some elements which are simply not explained and are therefore very confusing, but somehow this seems to be a thing Lynch tends to do in every of his movies, so what? I like some simple scenes like the opening monologue a whole lot. I LOVE the music (which played in my mind all the time while I read the book), and I think the characters are very strong and (for example Letho Atreides) sometimes full of tragedy.\n\nThe part I like the most though is the worm-part. I think the special effects are not always brilliant, but seeing the scenes with the worms, I am really awestruck because they are so impressing.\n\nAll in all, I think this is one of the more underrated movies in Science Fiction history. It may be because the director himself was not happy with it, or because fans expected too much from a simple two hour movie. I always enjoy watching this film and listening to the soundtrack.

I kind of hate the idea of delving too deep into a multiverse, because I think it muddles things too much, and defies the internal logic of most stories. Sure enough that was something I felt while watching this film. This movie cannot hold up to even the tiniest bit of analysis, because it creates plot holes that you can drive a freight train through. It\'s kind of sad because there were some moments in the movie that I genuinely loved, but all I can think about days later are the myriad of questions that I\'m left with because this movie created so many situations that make no sense.\n\nMy other big problem with Spider-Man: No Way Home is not really a fault of the movie, but more of the society we live in today. Living in an internet-focused culture, we are bombarded by ads and news stories that relate to the things that interest us. SInce I\'ve shown my love for all things MCU in the past, of course I see plenty of things crossing my radar about the upcoming films. I was able to avoid watching any trailers for this movie, which I thought would help, but by merely catching headlines of casting rumors I could foresee every surprise they built into it. Of course any logical mind could put two and two together once the guest appearances start, so I suppose this isn\'t a movie that is going to blow away audiences with its surprises.\n\nAs I said, though, my disappointment is quite frustrating because I also found many aspects of No Way Home so satisfying. They wrapped up some story elements nicely, and this might have contained some of the best acting in any Marvel movie. In particular, I found Zendaya so surprisingly strong, I was almost able to ignore her lack of character motivation in some key moments. She wasn\'t the only person in the film that behaved stupidly, in fact the central premise of the film is built on a horrible idea from Aunt May that seems altruistic, but lacks any 4th-dimensional thinking which I would expect from a genius like Peter Parker. But smart people being dumb is the catalyst of the entire story, as even Dr. Strange doesn\'t seem to think anything through, past Peter\'s initial request.\n\nNo Way Home is easily the most meta Spider-Man movie ever made, which is kind of shocking to say in a post \"Into the Spider-verse\" world. It\'s catering to the most die-hard fans in the world, but it\'s more of a nod to the fans of the Spider-Man movies. I was always a huge fan of the multitude of Spider-Man comic books when I was a collector, but I\'ve typically struggled with his portrayal in films. So, giving all these nods to things that came before Tom Holland took over the role on the big screen, falls a bit flat for me. One of the things I loved about this iteration of the character is that it avoided the cliches and saved us so much of the traditional Spider-Man origin story, but this movie back-pedaled and became a copy of a copy of a copy.\n\nThis return to cliche also sucked some of the emotion out of key moments as any fan of the character should know the same old tropes by now. I almost got emotional at the end because of the great acting performances, but the big emotional moment earlier in the film did nothing for me as all I could think was \"really, we\'re going there?\" There are some good laughs in the film, although I wonder how well it will hold up on rewatch. And I will rewatch this film, as I do with all MCU movies, but I think at this point Spider-Man: No Way Home sits as my least favorite in the franchise. In fact, I\'m at a point right now where I\'m questioning if I will keep being a diehard fan of everything the MCU churns out. This film wasn\'t what I\'d call a complete failure, but I\'m concerned the MCU is getting closer to one of those. Perhaps EndGame should have been exactly what the title implies.'),(1186,71,'9/10','one of the best cinema experiences','lucy_andrews-04052','15 December 2021','I\'m from the uk so we don\'t really do all that kind of cheering in cinemas.

However, on a lark and because it\'s apparently such a good film I decided to give the film a look. Well, I must say that thought I was not in love with the film it sure was exceptionally well made and had a lot to offer--even for folks like me.\n\nThe biggest reason I liked the movie and thought it was made so well was its rich and complex plot. At nearly three hours, there is lots and lots of time for the plot to slowly unfold. It also allowed for several concurrent plots to interweave themselves through the film--the story about the master criminals, the cops, another criminal as well as a rogue nut-job that just likes to kill. It\'s almost like a mini-series in this respect. I also loved how this was not a set-bound film but was made throughout LA--though I wonder how this was possible, as it must have tied up huge portions of Los Angeles! I also loved some of the characters--particularly Robert De Niro\'s oddly professional and scary criminal boss. It was one of his very best performances.\n\nThere\'s very little to complain about in the film, though I thought Al Pacino\'s character was a tad over-acted at times. Unlike De Niro, I had a harder time believing Pacino was real. Perhaps it\'s just me....\n\nOverall, if you don\'t mind the violence and the occasionally frenetic pace, then this is a film well wroth seeing.

Is it DeNiro\'s best performance? No. Is it Pacino\'s best performance? I\'d be lying if I said it was. Do the performances improve the story? Absolutely. Mann has written (he wrote it as well) a complex and exciting two-sided story that develops the hunter Vincent Hanna (Pacino) and the hunted Neil McCauley (De Niro) separately throughout much of the film. Underneath a hail of bullets Mann is able to paint both lead characters with the same brush by delving into the similarly tragic and chaotic personal lives of Hanna and McCauley, allowing for the final epic scene, which would have been too pretentious if it were not for the excellent performances of Pacino and De Niro.\n\nBottom Line: Not having seen this movie is akin to idiocy for anyone claiming to be a fan of movies. 9 out of 10'),(1194,72,'9/10','The Summit','bkoganbing','4 November 2008','One of the amazing things about Heat is that during an almost three hour running time of the film, your interest in what happens in the summit teaming of Al Pacino and Robert DeNiro never flags for a second. Part of the reason is because these guys are at the top of their profession and brought their A game to the parts.\n\nThe roles they have are not as good as Jake LaMotta, Jimmy Conway, or Max Cady for DeNiro or Frank Serpico, Michael Corleone, or Bobby Deefield for Pacino. But Neil McCauley master criminal for DeNiro and Jake Hanna dogged detective for Pacino does show these guys at their best.\n\nYou can best describe Heat as a long running version of Law and Order Criminal Intent with a big budget. Like that show the action shifts back from the cops to the criminals and smoothly for director/writer Michael Mann. We see both of these guys as rather similar to each other. DeNiro prides himself on the fact that he says he can drop any relationship if it interferes with work. And Pacino is on his third marriage and his mistress is the job. He\'s been a failure twice as a husband and about to go thrice in the romance department.\n\nMann gave Pacino and DeNiro a really outstanding cast for support in Heat. People like Val Kilmer are in DeNiro\'s gang, Jon Voight is the Sam Jaffe like mastermind of the operation. Pacino on his team has Mykel T. Williamson from Forrest Gump and Ted Levine best known as Captain Stottlemyre on Monk.\n\nThis action film also does not stint on woman\'s roles. Diane Venora is fine as Pacino\'s estranged wife. Amy Breneman is also good as DeNiro\'s woman who watches her man helplessly trapped by his own criminal rules go to his destruction. Best in the film on the distaff side is Ashley Judd as Val Kilmer\'s loyal wife who has one great choice given her by Williamson, betray her husband or lose their kid. See how she handles it.\n\nAlthough the scene was shoehorned into the plot and would never happen in real life, Pacino and DeNiro do meet and have a brief scene together over a cup of coffee in a diner. They compare notes so to speak and take the measure of the other guy. Since these two guys are the most acclaimed actors of their generation, the scene artificial though it is takes on a whole different dimension. It\'s like when writers give Queen Elizabeth and Mary Queen of Scots a climatic meeting scene even though in real life it never happened.\n\nBut like in Heat, it should have happened.'),(1195,72,'10/10','You find yourself rooting for both sides the entire film.','kevin_robbins','20 December 2021','Heat (1995) is a movie that is in my DVD collection that I recently rewatched on Tubi.

Devotees of classic cops and robbers flicks of old will no doubt take exception, but I believe that Michael Mann achieved some measure of perfection with Heat. To break this three-hour gem of a film down to its core, this is a film about men - strong men - and the supporting role that he women of the film have on them for better or worse. Take Pacino as good cop Vincent Hanna: one of the most intense characterizations of the tragic hero that I have ever witnessed, as he laments the demise of his third marriage to a pill-junkie wife. A fact which he discusses with his archnemesis (De Niro) in what history will regard as one of the most frenetic scenes in the history of film. The dialogue in this scene (at the very end of the first tape, if you own the VHS version) sets up the last half of the film beautifully, as our two rivals come to the joint realization that they have no hand in choosing the paths that will lead them to their ultimate confrontation: their very natures so define their respective actions that any attempt to do otherwise would simply be a waste of time. While I have heard others (who I am ashamed at times to call close friends) say that Heat drags in places, I will concede that there are moments in the film that require more than the cursory attention that they give to the movie they happen to be watching at any given time (I\'m sorry not every director is Jerry Bruckheimer), there are poignant developments of character in Heat that many would casually disregard. I am thinking of the interaction between the ex-con who finds conditional employment in a diner with an opportunistic scum of a boss, and whose girlfriend is so proud of him for swallowing his pride and not simply giving the sonofabitch a good pummeling. But there is a catharsis that I felt for that same ex-con when De Niro\'s character presents him with the opportunity to take just one more score, for old time\'s sake. Who doesn\'t feel for this guy - this minor character in a film with big-time heavyweights who gets to shine for a few brief moments. That\'s what Heat is really: a series of brief moments, some touching, others traumatic, and still others incredibly horrifying in the feelings that they inspire in the romantic who, like me sees not black or white portrayals of protagonist and villain, but a montage of grays that combine to create a vivid spectrum of film characterization that could not be found in hundreds of films combined.

It seems one of Michael Mann\'s main priorities was to make a film with a dreamlike feel to it, to portray LA as a dusty oil-painting on which complex characters could play out their lives. One of the main themes is the similarity of the career criminal and the street-wise cop. It is fascinating to find yourself really feeling for DeNiro\'s tragic bank-robber, a man of philosophical merit who realises he\'s stuck in a life of crime he doesn\'t want to lead. Pacino\'s cop is less easy to sympathise with, but he too leads an in-escapable life of guns and crime. What really stands out is the climax. On the whole, Heat has to be the best cops n\' robbers film ever made, indeed, one of the best films.

Sign in to vote.','\'Heat,\' a film of epic proportions on a common placed scale, provides all the essentials of a great crime drama and then some. With a fascinating storyline, involving characters, and Mann\'s sometimes poetic, sometimes gritty directing, \'Heat\' is arguably one of the best crime dramas.\n\nPerhaps the most unique feature of this movie is its manifold storyline, which focuses primarily on the main characters: Vincent Hanna and Neil McCauley. Because of this complex storyline, it almost seems as if one is watching two movies, with one about each of the two characters. While following Hanna\'s personal life, the movie shows how it is about more than just a cop in pursuit of a criminal. Hanna\'s marriage is deteriorating, his step daughter is falling apart, and, as wife Justine says, he lives his life more among the \"remnants of dead people.\" A man of two other failed marriages, Hanna\'s story is that of the strain of trying to fulfill both his professional and personal, where, every time, the professional wins out. Neil McCauley\'s story is that of a man who used to know his role: his job. Everything in his life revolved around making the next score (whether it be large or small). His story chronicles his relationships with the other men in his crew, and his relationship with Eady, his girlfriend who does not know all she should about him. The tensions build as Mann shows the two opposing strategies of each man as their paths (and thus their stories) draw closer together. When the two storylines do meet (at different points in the movie), the result is--for lack of a better word--epic. To say that these two major storylines are the only strong ones of the movie would do injustice to the many others (following Chris and his wife, for example); but to say that they are the driving force of the movie, to say that they are responsible for transforming a typical cops-and-robbers story is the best explanation.\n\nIn addition, the characters in this movie undoubtedly make it so successful. This cast comes as close as possible to being ensemble with two such huge main characters. And the cast is one of the best, at that. DeNiro. Little more needs to be said. Ever the master, his character, McCauley, can be on the one hand a ruthless robber and cold-hearted killer, on the other a warm friend and tender lover. And, despite his life of crime, McCauley\'s human side shows through. He will not kill unless he must, as seen through his anger at Waingro and bank heist. His warmer side shows through his relationships with his friends and girlfriend Eady. Pacino. Equally without need of praise. As always, he delivers an intense performance, here as Hanna, a workaholic obsessed with catching his man, while also fighting a losing battle to save his personal relationships. He may seem just the harsh cop, but he cares about every man under his command, about his stepdaughter, and, yes, even about McCauley. Through Hanna, Pacino shows just how torn such a man can be. Hanna demonstrates both coldness and compassion, both anger and sensitivity. Additionally strong is Val Kilmer, as Chris Shiherlis; with a raging temper, undying devotion, and a fierce will to persevere. Kilmer does an excellent job with the character of a flawed individual, whose flaws prevent him from lasting contentment, but against which flaws he continually strives. Ashley Judd is an unforgettable Charlene Shiherlis, who, despite a smaller roll, makes a lasting impression on the film. Tom Sizemore, as the implacable Michael Cheritto, and Jon Voight, as a gruff Nate, are both likeable (because of their human sides) and despicable (because of their professions). Each does excellent work. And equally fine are Diane Venora, as Justine, and Natalie Portman, as Justine\'s daughter Lauren. As Venora is strong opposite Pacino, so Amy Brenneman, Eady, is an equally strong opposite of DeNiro. In a cast so full of big names, it is so rewarding to see everyone come together to make the characters each have their own place in the film.\n\nAnd Michael Mann\'s direction of the movie keeps the film moving while providing a tremendous combination of action and drama. He moves from scene to scene quickly and effortlessly. He also switches between the many storylines logically and fluidly, none of the story being lost. Each scene leaves its own, unmistakable impression, and each scene of each storyline builds upon the previous. Action scenes are handles crisply but grittily. The gunshots are loud, the blood is abundant, but Mann wisely does not linger on the horror of the moment. He paints a realistic picture, but keeps to the topic. The action never becomes more important than the drama. Mann is also responsible for what is perhaps the greatest robbery scene ever. Here, his more gritty sense of style is what makes this scene so believable. And, despite the enormous cast, Mann was still able to keep his agenda clear, and orchestrate so much talent into a coherent movie. Michael Mann deserves credit for both his vision and ability to express it.\n\nBecause of these and other well done aspects, \'Heat\' is one of the most powerful crime dramas ever made.'),(1201,72,'6/10','I obviously don\'t get it ...','Jouford','25 April 2020','Let me start by saying that Heat isn\'t a terrible movie. In fact, it\'s not a bad movie at all. I just think that it\'s incredibly overrated. I\'m not a huge fan of Michael Mann\'s work in general. I find his films to be no more than very long music videos. His movies seem to epitomise style over substance to me, and Heat is no different. DeNiro and Pacino chew through the scenes like they normally do. That\'s a given. The rest of the cast are as competent and watchable, but the film doesn\'t feel deep enough for me. Though judging by the way everyone else is rating it, I must be missing something, even after watching it three times. I\'m sorry that I don\'t like this film.

I don`t know if I`ve been watching too much MTV but a major problem I`ve had with a great number of movies coming out of Hollywood studios since the early 1990s is that they`re too long for their own good and I wish to add HEAT to this list since its running time is taken up with too many unnecessary scenes . If these scenes had been ditched at script stage not only would we have had a shorter film we`d have had a far better one . Take the scene in the coffee bar where the gang have just carried out the initial heist and Neil teaches Waingro a lesson by banging his head off the table . Seeing as they`re shown throghout the story to be well organised , professional villains why would Neil draw attention to themselves by assaulting Waingro in this way ? It`s a scene that lacks any credibility and should not have been included . There`s another problem with too many domestic scenes , the film tries to show the audience the marital marital/romantic life of every major character , cop and robber .

It has some drawbacks that wouldn\'t make me recommend this for family viewing - tons of f- words by Al Pacino and a few bloody scenes, but as far as a fascinating crime story: wow!\n\nThis movie made modern-day history because it was the first time two of the great actors of this generation - Pacino and Robert De Niro - finally acted together in the same film. Those two didn\'t disappoint, either. They were great to watch and one of the huge highlights of the film, to me, was when they faced each other in a simple conversation over a cup of coffee. That conversation has always fascinated me, no matter how many times I\'ve heard it. It was such a \"landmark\" scene that It\'s even the subject of a short documentary on the special-edition DVD.\n\nAs with the conversation scene, the shootout segment in the streets of Los Angeles still astounds me no matter how many times I see it. The other action scenes are intense and memorable, too, and the cast in here is deep. This isn\'t just Pacino and De Niro. It\'s Val Kilmer, Ashley Judd, Jon Voight, Diana Venora, Natlie Portman, Tom Sizemore, Amy Brenamann, Wes Studi, Ted Levine, Mykelti Williamson, on and on.\n\nPut that fabulous cast under Michael Mann, one of the best directors in business, add a great soundtrack and interesting camera-work and you have a great film. At three hours long, it never bores one and at same time, doesn\'t overdo the action, either. I read one critic criticize this film because of the time taken to examine the personal lives of the main characters, but you can\'t have three hours of nothing but action. The only scene I felt went on a bit too long was the ending chase at the airport, but that\'s nitpicking considering the film as a whole.\n\nThis is just one of those movies where a great cast and director live up to their billing.'),(1206,72,'10/10','Pacino and De Niro together... simply great !','Peres-2','13 January 1999','Most of the comments I\'ve read here agree that this is a great movie.

When I first saw this movie I was sure it would be another violent crime movie that I would never want to see again. I have since seen it 4 times and have a copy of my own.

Would have been better 60 minutes shorter with half the characters','bayou_hannibal','30 May 2012','Having seen almost every classic and influential crime drama of the past 30 years, I finally got around to seeing Heat. Having heard about how influential it has been in other movies and video games, I couldn\'t believe that I had waited so long to see this movie. Boy, was I disappointed. This movie is far from the masterpiece that I was led to believe. Other than a couple of great crime scenes (and a little bit of great action), I can\'t think of much that this film had that would make me want to see it again.\n\nWhile I wouldn\'t characterize the acting as bad, I can\'t think of anyone in this movie who gave a performance that is among their better ones. Al Pacino is practically a caricature of himself the entire time. He overacts in every scene and he yells about half of his lines. Robert Deniro has the same scowl on his face and speaks in pretty much the same voice for the whole movie. Pacino and Deniro fans looking for some \"tough guy\" porn will find plenty of it here.\n\nUltimately, Heat is a movie that could have been made better by cutting about half the content. It is loaded with characters that are poorly developed, but are dramatically presented as if you are supposed to give a crap about any of them. One of them gets killed after about four minutes of screen time, and after that, we see his grieving wife. Rather than cry with her, I just kind of rolled my eyes. Another gang members death is presented with the drama akin to a squad mate getting killed in a war movie. I could have cared less. Val Kilmer\'s subplot centers around the tenuous relationship that he has with his wife. Al Pacino has a lousy third marriage and Robert Deniro somehow manages to have a romance side plot that is neither relevant nor believable.\n\nThere is even a suicide attempt scene that has nothing whatsoever to do with the story – a diversion that will have you scratching your head, wondering why so much celluloid was wasted on it. Without exception, every single scene with a female in it could have been left on the cutting room floor, and not one shred of value would have been lost. None of the characters are sympathetic or well developed enough for you to want to see their romances work or to be able to share their pain. It would have worked well maybe in a television series where you would have more time to develop the characters, but here, all of the side plot material is really boring.\n\nOne of the draws of this movie seems to be that it is a \"realistic\" and non ideal take on human behavior. Okay, I get that, but if you are going to go with the \"realistic\" approach, then don\'t ruin it with the occasional unbelievable scene or plot hole. The biggest offender is the famous bank robbery scene in the middle of the movie. It would have been spectacular in an action movie that didn\'t take itself seriously. But in Heat, I couldn\'t stop thinking about how absurd it was that a few guys with automatic weapons were able to cut through the entire LAPD like a hot knife through butter, escaping clean in the process. I still greatly enjoyed that scene, largely because it\'s just a great action scene that is well choreographed and shot. However, it\'s sort of out of place in this film.\n\nI\'ll give Heat some credit for not being a by-the-numbers cops and robbers movie. Maybe it is this uniqueness and the time of its release that made it so popular. Upon reflection though, there have been many crime and caper movies over the past few decades that are more entertaining than this one. Scarface, Reservoir Dogs, The Usual Suspects, to name but a few. While I didn\'t hate this movie, I certainly don\'t think that it deserves a place in the Top 10 greatest crime dramas.'),(1210,72,'10/10','One of the best films of the 90\'s','eddieknocker','17 January 2005','I am assuming I am commenting on this film for those who have not seen this film and for those people I pity you.

An awesome supporting cast firing on all cylinders. Arguably the best \"shoot-out\" in any film - ever. What more do you want???\n\nIt\'s a long film but there is not one wasted scene in it. Even the incidental story lines - for example, the recently paroled ex-cell mate of Deniro whose first job is in a \"grill\" working for a nasty, exploitative boss and then ends-up as a stand-in getaway driver for Deniros crew. It just adds weight to the whole film. All the domestic dramas of the good-guys and the bad-guys that you wouldn\'t get in the typical cops and robbers film are shown in loving detail and nothing is rushed.

In this one, it\'s hard-faced Diane Venora whining about how cop Al Pacino isn\'t THERE for her and her daughter (Natalie Portman), how she gets only part of his life, etc. Haven\'t we suffered through this boring situation in a hundred cop pictures? Then there are the uninteresting marital problems criminal Val Kilmer is having with Ashley Judd; who cares? Finally, there\'s the loony, preposterous, extraneous, wholly unbelievable relationship Robert De Niro has with Amy Brenneman, who plays a lovestruck artist/shopgirl who takes one look at De Niro, begins flirting with him, and is soon taking him to bed. Yeah, right: Here\'s a beautiful, glamorous-looking young woman who throws herself at a middle-aged, mean-and-careworn-and-greasy-looking guy who initially pretends to be a salesman and carries on a halting conversation worthy of a dullard.

It is the excellently choreographed dog fights that remain in the mind longer than anything as they are high octane, dazzling bursts of excitement which bring the film to life. However, fighter jet sequences do not make a film and it is the plot where Top Gun has some occasional problems.\n\nParts of the story are overly cheesy and clichéd. The proud to be American theme is dire, repetitive and anyone who dislikes over patriotism in films will despise this. The story line involving Tom Cruise and Tom Skerrit approaches boredom and is the pinnacle of Top Gun\'s cheese. \'Cheese\' is OK, as long as it is not serious and that is where that specific story line falls flat. The fun cheesy parts are some of the films best moments. The volleyball scene is truly a classic and the four actors involved are genuinely enjoying themselves. The relationship between Tom Cruise and Anthony Edwards is also very moving at times and the dynamic they have makes for great viewing.\n\nThe acting is what saves Top Gun from being Tinsel town garbage. Tom Cruise launched his career with this film. His cocky smile makes him perfect for this role and Cruise does fantastically at portraying a determined, passionate character. It is the emotional scenes where Cruise really sets himself apart from his peers. Cruise provides the few scenes where the audience are made to feel any emotion and he carries out his responsibility creditably. Anthony Edwards as Goose is also effective as the man who takes second spot to Cruise\'s Maverick. He is instantly popular with the audience with his wit, humour and charm. Val Kilmer and Rick Rossovich are great as the rivals. They play off each other really well and do a fantastic job to personify arrogance. Michael Ironside does what he does best and once again, manages to go through a whole film without smiling.\n\nThe story between Cruise and Kelly McGillis is very romantic and sensual. The heat between them is conveyed very well on screen and it is this that sets Top Gun above films such as Iron Eagle and Chuck Norris films.\n\nBerlin\'s \'Take My Breath Away\' is a song that still gets a good deal of airplay and suits this film to perfection; it\'s cheesy and its 80s. The music is very effective at setting the mood and complements the feel of the film.\n\nTop Gun is a film that achieves its objectives, to entertain.

I was pretty tired of hearing the endless references and not understanding them, so I decided to finally sit down and give it a shot. It\'s enjoyable, but I think it was more of a product of it\'s time. It\'s better appreciated as an 80\'s film than a film in general. Now I don\'t mean that the effects don\'t hold up, because they do. I just feel like it had all the fruit at the right time, where as now some of them might be expired or just not as popular.

Tom Cruise has been better for sure but he has some fun with this role. But when you look at Collateral and even last years Edge of Tomorrow, Cruise is a legitimate actor, but I think at this point in his career he was just trying to make it big. He\'s extremely cocky and not particularly fond of anybody trying to tell him what to do. He needs wisdom and a life altering event that humbles him. Well he definitely gets both of those. But his cockiness is why the character became so famous. It\'s one of the main reasons why I think a sequel could be both great and potentially unnecessary. We go on a journey with Maverick throughout the film. A journey that changes his character quite a bit, so I\'m not sure a second look at his character works. On the other-hand, knowing where his character ends up, it can be an interesting passing of the torch story if you will.\n\nWhat I think was missing here was more of a back story with Maverick. We get a little bit with his father and a quick remark about his mother, but I would have liked to see more of how he became so cocky and conceded.

Tho to be fair to both Cruise {great and cocky} and Kelly McGillis {miscast and poor}, their love scenes are tender and comfortably raising the pulse beat in 80s cinema sensuality. Much macho posturing drips from every other frame, be it Cruise tearing around on his motorcycle or Val Kilmer {Iceman} pumping out his bare chest and smirking away. It could be said that Top Gun is an advertisement for the homo-erotic army! Yet in spite of its obvious daftness, Top Gun is very much a thrill ride. Disengage yourself from the preposterous nature of events out of the sky, and it royally entertains as an action picture of worth. Zooming jet sequences and sparky man to man beefcake exchanges more than make this a worthy revisit, especially now in this HD and booming home cinema age.\n\nIt\'s not great for sure, and anyone really proclaiming it to be as such has been having MTV filtered into their brains for the last 20 years. But it is an entertaining film, and the people involved with it knew exactly what they was doing, and when one looks at the ream of poor imitations that have followed over the years? Well Top Gun actually holds up as one of the most quintessential 80s pictures ever made....for better or worse? 7/10'),(1222,73,'9/10','Beautifully fake','scott.west','30 May 2000','There is a school of thought that says all movies should be compared on an absolute scale. It would say that movies must have a high level of credibility or familiarity in order to be \"good\" movies. People who fall into this category simply should not watch Top Gun. They won\'t enjoy it. Other people take the opposite, but no more valid approach of looking a each movie individually, disregarding all else but the movie. For these people, no outside reality or credibility is important, because for them, a movie exists to entertain in whatever way it chooses to. These people would enjoy Top Gun very much. It is extremely doubtful that the producers ever even considered making Top Gun as a portrait of a fighter pilot\'s life, and this is why it is entertaining. It is a rare type of movie, one that no one dares to make today, one that not only transcends reality, but wears it as a mask into the world of fantasy. Everything from the wild dogfights to the fake love to the over the top glamorized (or should I say canonized) characters lets you know that this is a good old American hero drama. That is why it is a horrible and fraudulent portrait of reality, and that is why I love it.'),(1223,73,'6/10','No real plot, but some fun characters and the odd great quote','jtindahouse','17 June 2020','Back when I worked in the aviation industry \'Top Gun\' was always a big deal. Pilots couldn\'t believe I hadn\'t seen it. A lot of them even said it was the reason they pursued that career path. I even have a close friend who has it as their favourite movie. And yet it still didn\'t really interest me. In fact if there wasn\'t a sequel coming out for it soon I may never have gotten around to watching it. It always seemed to me, from the little I knew about it, that it was a plotless movie. And having seen it that was a correct assessment. The movie isn\'t really about anything. The only thing that saves it from being a complete dumpster fire is the charisma of the characters.\n\nIt\'s funny to watch a movie so old that the line \'I could tell you, but then I\'d have to kill you\" is still included and even gets a laugh from the other characters. The film hasn\'t really aged that well in a lot of ways. The way the action sequences are filmed can make them quite hard to watch. This is something I hope they do far better in the sequel. I certainly enjoyed the characters interacting on land far more than the often quite lengthy action sequences in the air.\n\nThe film has some memorable quotes which have aged very well. It also has a very good cast who do an excellent job of lifting the film up and making it what it is. It\'s not a film I can recommend as a must-watch though unfortunately. There simply isn\'t enough to it for me to do that.'),(1224,73,'7/10','Entertaining macho tale of airborne acrobatics and dogfight daredeviltry','roghache','4 June 2006','Maybe this is something of a U.S. military naval recruitment film but if taken not too seriously, this testosterone laced movie actually makes for quite entertaining viewing. The jet maneuvers shown are both impressive & exciting and might tend to increase the viewer\'s respect (as it certainly did mine) for the amazing skill and incredible nerve of real life fighter pilots.\n\nThe story revolves around a bold, daring, and overconfident navy fighter pilot, Lieutenant Pete Mitchell (call name \'Maverick\'), who is sent to the Top Gun Naval Flying School along with his close pal, Goose. Maverick strives to prove himself the best pilot in this demanding course, but faces both stiff competition from a fellow pilot named Iceman as well as personal conflict dealing with his own haunting demons following the mysterious death of his father, also an air ace pilot. Meanwhile, he falls for a lovely civilian astrophysics instructor, Charlotte (Charlie) Blackwood.\n\nTom Cruise is well cast in the role of the hotshot pilot...the cocky, audacious, fearless, but ultimately conflicted and anguished Maverick. Kelly McGillis portrays his often antagonistic love interest, Charlie, who\'s as smart as she is pretty. Other stars include Tom Skerrit as a real top gun flight instructor, Commander Metcalf (Viper), who proves to be both a skilled and professional pilot but also a compassionate individual. Meg Ryan appears in her screen debut as Goose\'s perky, fun loving young wife, Carole Bradshaw, a minor role and one which I personally found rather irritating.\n\nI half expected that I\'d find this movie just all too macho, but it\'s actually quite engaging to watch. Maverick\'s personal story, his inner strife, and his romance with Charlie prove less riveting than the incredible airborne stunts with these jets. Yes, they have to be among the best aerial shots ever. This film was made during the Cold War era with its USSR enmity so there are appearances by enemy Russian MiG fighters, naturally cast as the intrusive villains of the piece. The film also does a great job at depicting all the male bonding between these pilots...the camaraderie, rivalry, banter, inter dependency, and genuine close friendship.\n\nMaverick is a fighter pilot who, according to Charlie, is only happy when he\'s \'going Mach Two with his hair on fire\'. He\'s heard to remark just prior to climbing into the cockpit, \'I feel the need for speed\'. He also takes great delight in unexpected and forbidden fly byes next to the control tower, scaring the living daylights out of his colleagues and causing them to spill their coffee. I love the little paper airplane touch with Charlie! Guess how Maverick transports himself around the city while on the ground...that\'s right, zipping about on a motorcycle!\n\nThe movie features highly effective cinematography of these jets taking off from the aircraft carrier, all accompanied by a fabulous racy musical soundtrack. The romantic scenes are of course to the Oscar winning song \'Take My Breath Away\'. Although it certainly features its sad moments, Top Gun is on the whole simply a lively and fun movie to watch.'),(1225,73,'5/10','Nothing exciting happens','SafReviews','2 September 2022','I only watched this movie because I wanted to watch it before watching Top Gun Maverick.

There\'s no uniqueness to it compared to other love story movies, except there\'s some fighter planes in it. I\'m not really a fan of fighter planes, but I did like the visuals of them and the fight scenes.

Sign in to vote.','If there\'s ever proof of the cachet of Naval Aviation, this is it. Those poor Air Force guys got a trio of \"Iron Eagle\" flicks that went from bad to horrible, whereas the Navy flyboys got this great 1980\'s classic. Sure, it\'s cheesy and corny, but it makes the cheese and corn taste pretty damn good. A cynic might argue that it\'s just a two hour long Navy recruiting ad (one that worked for me, two years later I found my ass in Pensacola sweating through AOCS, short for Aviation Officer Candidate School, the program immortalized in \"An Officer and a Gentleman\") but by making a pro-Navy movie, the filmmakers also got invaluable technical assistance from top Navy aviators, and it shows.\n\nFor starters, although this movie takes numerous liberties in order to entertain, the basic setup, in which fighter pilots from the fleet get sent to NAS Miramar, aka, \"Top Gun\" for intensive training, is 100% accurate. The Navy, back during Vietnam, was getting sick of losing too many pilots in air-to-air combat. The problem, they discovered, was their fighter jocks had been trained for purely long-range missile interceptions, meaning they\'d lost their dogfighting skills. And, in Vietnam, several American planes were accidentally shot down by their own side by missiles, so, as a safety factor, enemy planes had to be visually identified, meaning American pilots were back to engaging the enemy at short range, hence the need for dogfighting. The \"Top Gun\" school was started as a result, and the rest is history.\n\nNow, back to the movie. Tom Cruise is Maverick, a hotshot pilot but also somewhat unstable. If \"Risky Business\" launched his career as a movie star, then \"Top Gun\" cemented it. Guys wanted to be like him, and women of course lusted after him. The plot is pure formula, but executed with consummate professionalism. The team who put this movie together knew exactly how to push all the right buttons. But the crème de la crème is surely the flying. I don\'t think that any movie, before or since, has ever rendered air combat in a more convincing and dramatic fashion. For nearly 100 years fighter pilots have been the modern equivalent of olden knights, men who brought a sense of glamour and romance to the deadly art of war, and this movie gives them a fitting tribute.\n\n8/10'),(1227,73,'7/10','Michael Bay\'s biggest inspiration. A romantic, stylish, cheesy and over the top 80s nostalgia film with an eye candy Tom Cruise. A cult classic indeed.','quiqueperezsoler','9 October 2020','I like this movie, really. I think it is one of the biggest pieces of 80s navy/military nostalgia out there. Its saturated colors, disregard for technical accuracy and the over the top personalities of every character reminds us why the 80s were so great. The extravagantic flashy and superficially clear emotions evoqued in this movie are enough to convince people it has a story.\n\nI have only seen these movie elements in Michael Bay movies. Movies like Armageddon (1998) or the first Transformers one. And I don\'t mean it in a bad way, I actually understand the appeal of such a movie. For some it\'d be a \"flight/pilot-porn movie\", for others an eye candy piece of young Tom Cruise seeing there\'s a shirtless volleyball scene; and for others, like me, is brainless entertainment.\n\nSurprisingly enough, I never thought this movie was cliche or cheesy. If this movie is cheesy, then every other movie from the 80s is also cheesy and with that logic none of them are. Because this is the sort of feel and personality the movies had back then. The difference is, the cliched and cheesy parts make the movies endearing because they add a unique personality to the already well-crafted stories.\n\nAnd this movie would have been a heartbreaking story with a positive outcome but the story is just too bland even for the time. I love 80s movies, I have watched a lot of them, but this one unfortunately falls for me in some story aspects. It never tries anything new than the most stereotypical route for every single character to a point of even being able to predict the turn of events.\n\nIN CONCLUSION; it is a fun, entertaining and plain dumb romantic-drama (not action drama as there\'s very little action, just long pilot flight scenes). Of course I have my problems with it (like the fact that I have no idea who is talking most of the times in the flight scenes because everybody sounds the same when shouting and they are all wearing helmets) but I realised that wasn\'t the reason this movie is a cult classic. Thanks to Tom Cruise\'s grin and the incredible energy and charisma he brings to the movie, he delivers an incredible performance that would cement his career as an action hero. The romance is amazingly well done and the soundtrack is an 80s nostalgia trip. A great movie to pass the time and not reflect upon or no take-away.'),(1228,73,'6/10','I got the need, the need for speed!','freemantle_uk','3 June 2020','I watched Top Gun because I thought it would be a good idea to prepare myself for the sequel.

It was the film that showed Tom Cruise had some action credentials, gave Val Kilmer an early role and was Tony Scott\'s first big success as a feature film director. It was a macho film for people who are interested in the military and military tech - although some people have said it has a homo-erotic subtext.\n\nThe issue with Top Gun is the story is thin. It was simply about characters training at an elite flight school. The character work was decent enough, Maverick and Goose\'s friendship was believable and whilst Iceman was made out to be an antagionist, he did rise some valid points.\n\nI didn\'t find the air combat that interesting.

And not just the main storyline which makes little sense and the villains are comedic, but almost every interaction ends up with the viewer asking \"but, why?\" or \"how does it even make sense?\".\n\nThe assembly of heroes (what the movie is about) is also rushed as hell, and the motivation of the people to join is straight-up nonexistent in most of the cases and is simply skipped entirely.\n\nAs for the villain who comes to find mysterious troubling rebels, apparently every single person knows who are the rebels and how to find them and shares that information to the first stranger they meet. It\'s not like they are even hiding.\n\nNext, combat and action scenes. Blasters that penetrate people in armor through, but can\'t penetrate a thin piece of wood. Remember when in the new Star Wars trilogy a red guard could strike Ray but was just making dumb random moves to simulate action? Well, it\'s absolutely the same here. Maximum drama, lots of slow motion, frequent switch of the scenes every few seconds and very little sense.\n\nThe acting is ok, but it\'s difficult to judge the actors if they do good because the script tells them to follow an unnatural character arc in the first place. I\'d say Sofia played Kora well, but Kora is just a poor character which is out of place in the very story she\'s central.\n\nIt\'s not all bad.

This requires exactly no more suspension of disbelief than any of the blockbuster comic book hero movies flooding the market. Do you want to put the same filter of realism on ANY of those? Do you think, any of the Marvel superheroes make any sense at all? Its all emotions and action which this movie has plenty of. It\'s bubblegum. So just get your emotional rush and leave it at that. It\'s not going to win any awards but does that make the slightest bit of difference for the majority of people who will like it?\n175 out of 304 found this helpful. Was this review helpful?

First, I\'m sick of the 100 pound women taking on a bunch of 240 pound men and winning. Nobody has ever bought this crap, and it takes you out of the movie. Try letting the women use her brain to out think these bad guys instead.\n\nIt\'s hard to judge this movie on it\'s own because it\'s basically a women zipping around the galaxy putting together a team to fight the bad guys. We get to know each recruit a little bit as they are approached by the woman.\n\nSo, this movie is watchable for the special effects, but not much else. It\'s basically an introduction of all the characters and a basic background of the woman\'s story. It doesn\'t offer much by itself. They should have made this a 3.5 or 4 hour movie and included part 2.\n\nAnyway, it\'s still watchable but by itself, it\'s not very memorable.

As for the action sequences, imagine if a fanboy, got a hold of a camcorder and shot a load of matrix style inspired scenes, after the 2nd sequence it becomes quite annoyed and nauseating.\n\nIt Almost like they started filming, then decided to write a plot based on previous literature or films.

Can\'t wait to see more from this story as it progresses. Was it the best movie ever? No. But not worth the many scores below 5 I\'ve been seeing.

There are a lot of them, and they could have been really good. But the editing are just a bunch of normal speed, slow speed clipping to make it look good, and the bad guys just stand still doing nothing while the \"hero\" spends minutes moving around in the open...\n\nCGI/Greenscreen galore.. but very well done. So this is perhaps the strongest part of the movie.\n\nWaisted and nonsense slowmo sections... there are so many of them... and they are so pointless and gives nothing to the movie. There are movies and directors that know how to use slow motion sequences in a movie, and then there are this movie and director, that did not take that class... it\'s just a waist of time.\n\nIn summary, if you are able to ignore all the writing, dialogue, acting/directing issues... its a passable scifi action movie.\n\nThe movie could have been so much better, because there is a decent enough story underneath.. and they obviously had enough money to do what they wanted...\n\nI\'m assuming Netflix payed for this. So I\'m guessing that there where a big payday for writer/director and no requirements for quality on the delivered product.

It\'s not Star Wars, but more Flash Gordon (1980) without the cheese in visual style.\n\nThe plot is pretty simple following the template of Seven Samurai, but suffers from too much world building exposition. They say \"it\'s much better to show than tell\", but Rebel Moon counter acts that statement. Sometimes a single sentence will do. Look at Star Wars as an example. George Lucas didn\'t have the money to do tons of flashback sequences and used dialague, which was just as good or even better leaving it up to the audience\'s imagination. We didn\'t need a 10 minute sequence for Kora. That time could have been used to develop the other characters, who are sorely lacking in depth.\n\nI know that Snyder loves to use slow motion to highlight moments, but he went a bit overboard with some shots. It was used where it really wasn\'t needed in some stituations.\n\nOverall the movie is good, but it\'s very hard to digest in one viewing. It\'s like Underworld where it takes 2-3 times to absorb it all.

Now.\n\nThere are a few things you should expect from a Zack Snyder movie:\n\n1) Stunning visuals. This entire movie is sci-fi eye candy with high levels of imagination.\n\n2) Amazing music. Of course it\'s by Junkie XL. He has done many of Snyder\'s other movies.\n\n3) Lots of BEASTLY slow-motion shots. Some people complain about him overusing it. Not me.

That\'s fine. Every crowd likes their own kind of music.\n\nObjectively this is what Snyder produces: gritty, dark, unhappy, overly serious, tedious stuff. Most of its average, with a few exceptions. But there\'s always cool stuff to look at. The usual Snyder-verse effects are on full display: long establishing shots, fight scenes using slo-mo and speed shifting, and massive objects being viewed by terrified onlookers. He\'s kind of a poor man\'s Villaneuve.\n\nThe rabid followers can say what they want about \"The Snyder Cut\" Justice League, but the reality is there\'s no broad market for unrelentingly dismal sludge. Why isn\'t there a Judge Dredd movie coming out soon? Or another Punisher film? Dark and too serious isn\'t fun to spend money on. Especially when it\'s not all that new.\n\nI do have to laugh though, at all the media hacks that are pissing and moaning about how derivative this is. And it is. But it mostly feels that way because Snyder wrote a script for a stand alone Star Wars story and was told by Lucasfilm (or maybe it was Disney) \"thanks, but no thanks\".\n\nSo he went to the streaming giant that loves to produce expensive projects so they can cancel them before they can develop any traction. This is that script brought to life. Or death, as Netflix may have it.\n\nIt\'s not nice to hammer on creatives. But I for one am sick and tired of the waif-ish 90 pound girl warrior movies that have been all the rage lately. And while Boutella (Kora, the protagonist in Rebel Moon) was excellent as Jaylah in Star Trek Beyond, I\'m over it. Other than Gunpowder Milkshake (which was hilarious) it\'s all a bunch of BS. I don\'t care if Maggie Q or Daisy Ridley (both decent actresses btw) are in it or not (they aren\'t in this, in case you\'re confused), it\'s stupid. It was bad enough when Arnold, Sly and Bruce were ignoring the laws of physics in their various franchises, but we\'re all a little more savvy now and wouldn\'t buy that stuff from them in today\'s market either. But maybe I\'m wrong, because there are now 4 Expendables movies in existence. God save us from the people who are buying tickets to those.\n\nThe review of the performances? Boutella? Strictly two note delivery. Honsu? Not bad, dour and angry. Hunaam? Possibly the most nuanced.\n\nThe plot? Star Wars excuse aside, it\'s a mess. The preposterousness of engaging with their Seven Samurai recruits at moments when each is faced with a crucial test is just lazy storytelling.\n\nThe villains? One dimensional and very unconvincing. One, the most visible, a bizarre space nazi foil, is so predictable and poorly written that he could be dropped into any of a number of other films. The other? The supposedly all powerful Big Bad who apparently has the power of life over death is a comic book trope of a villain. Evil for evil\'s sake. And the dumb resurrection of the former by the latter begs the question: how do you threaten a subordinate that you just brought back to life? And instead of original visuals, Snyder dips deeply into the visually obscene as replacement for creativity.\n\nHere\'s a thought: (which the trailer for Part II indicated might really be a thing) the very last image is of a rogue droid, having gone \"wild\" after killing one of its \"masters\", standing up in a field, wearing a crown of deer antlers. Now that would/will? Have been (might be) a story worth exploring.\n\nThere are much better choices to spend two hours on.

That\'s what makes cinema so magical. It\'s personal. You can love the meat of the movie, or you can love the trimmings.\n\nThere\'s a bunch of good stuff here. Most people my age will refer to \"Superman\" as THE definitive superhero film. None will ever take it\'s place. A position no doubt dictated by the age we were when first viewing it. As with films like \"Star Wars\" and \"Raiders of the Lost Ark\", WHEN you experience them is just as important as HOW you experience them.\n\nAs we age, youth\'s eyes fade. Cynicism creeps in. Experience leads us to see the many injustices this life offers and we become more critical... less likely to accept that which we would rather believe. After all, an adult who clings to the youthful ideals of wonder is simply naive... right?\n\nTo this day, the opening title sequence for \"Superman\" fills me with the same magical joy it did over twenty years ago. Never was a score so perfectly crafted around a film. John Williams and Richard Donner created such an indelible experience that over 25 yrs later, Bryan Synger will use the same music and theme to bring the magic to a new generation of wondrous eyes.\n\nAs for me though, this will always remain the best.'),(1260,75,'8/10','Unbelievable...','xxdisintegrationxx','1 July 2006','Having recently seen the huge disappointment: Superman Returns, I felt an obligation to watch this version to see how it measured up. I couldn\'t believe my eyes, and ears! \'My God!\' I thought, \'Characters that actually interact with one another!\'. That is one of the key elements Superman Returns was missing: dialogue. This movie had so much fun with the story, and the characters, that despite its lack of modern effects, it was still immensely enjoyable to watch. There was real character development, real humor (particularly the scenes between Lex and Otis, which I found hysterical) and a palpable chemistry between Lois and Clark/Superman. From the very beginning, this movie grabs you tightly and keeps you interested. It has an enlivening effect on you, where you feel genuinely happy after watching it, which, to my understanding, is what the movies are all about. Gene Hackman had great one-liners, for instance,\"Otis, do you know why the number 200 is so vitally descriptive to both you and I? Because it\'s your weight, and my IQ\", and the entire cast sat right. The roles fit, the effects (for their time) were great, and the script was wonderful. It\'s amazing to me, that movies like this can still hold up against movies that are made with the gross national product of a small country.

Sign in to vote.','Every once in a while you\'ll be flipping channels or meandering through the aisles of the local videorama, and you will stumble upon a film that takes you back to your childhood - and the child-like wonder that accompanied it. After 2 decades, as well as numerous (inferior) sequels and remakes, the original Superman is back.\n\nWell, okay, maybe this wasn\'t the ORIGINAL one, but certainly no other version of the legend has had such a lasting impact as this one. Nor has any other telling of the tale been as thorough and ambitious as that put forth by Director Richard Donner and Story writer Mario Puzo. Add to that the utterly inspired (and inspiring) score by John Williams, and you have a dose of that good old movie magic. Even the opening credits manage to raise your adrenaline levels, as the Superman symbol soars through space across the screen and Williams\' opening theme perfectly builds to a masterful crescendo. It will make you want to stand up from your couch and soar out of the nearest window, though I don\'t recommend it if you live on anything above the first floor.\n\nThe film begins on Superman\'s home world of Krypton, a dazzling planet dotted by crystalline cities which, combined again with William\'s incredible theme music, seem to present an image of heaven itself. A super-race of highly advanced beings, the Kryptonians\' only weakness is their pride, as the infant Superman\'s father, Jor-el points out. It is that pride that leads them to ignore Jor-el\'s warnings that the planet is doomed by an impending supernova. In a last ditch effort to save his son, as well as some remnant of his race, he sends his infant son Kal-el to the planet Earth in a deep space probe. Marlon Brando, in the role of Jor-el, gives one of his best performances. His role is the stuff of Hollywood legend, since he was paid 4 million dollars for his role of about 10 minutes, but despite his exorbitant fee and minimal screen time, his performance is no less worthy.\n\nThe probe crashes in a farmer\'s field in the early 1950\'s, to be discovered by the Kents, with Glen Ford in the role of Pa Kent. Though he seems to have even less screen time than Brando, his role as the young Superman\'s moral example is no less pivotal to the story. Superman\'s childhood and most of his teen years are completely skipped over, however, Jeff East gives an excellent portrayal of the teen Clark Kent, who is only beginning to discover the real extent of his powers.\n\nMost of the supporting cast equally distinguish themselves. Gene Hackman creates a charming and amusing villain in Lex Luthor, and while Margot Kidder\'s portrayal of Lois Lane is a bit forced and grating at times, she still shines with a kind of charm, and it is always fun to watch her slip from the tough-as-nails reporter to the flustered schoolgirl every time the Man of Steel hits the scene. If you still don\'t like her performance, watch the \"Lois Lane screen tests\" in the special features section of the DVD, which includes tryouts by various prominent actresses of the day. After watching them, I think you\'ll agree that the filmmakers made the right casting choice.\n\nBut of course, the person we will remember the most is Christopher Reeve as Superman, and this is the way he should be remembered. It was certainly his greatest role, and although he overplayed the nerdy and fumbling Clark Kent, and his Superman sometimes pauses to deliver silly platitudes, he does so with an air of wry amusement. He may act like a goody two-shoes, but mostly he just seems to be having a good time showing off, and damn it, why shouldn\'t he? He\'s Superman, after all. If I could fly, you could damn well bet I\'d be showing off too. This is confirmed in a brief but enjoyable restored scene in which, after saving Lois Lane and the President, as well as foiling several crimes, Superman flies back to his Fortress of Solitude to discuss it with his \"Father\", or rather, the persona of Jor-el which has been preserved in memory crystals and sent to earth with the infant Kal-el, so that he could benefit from Jor-el\'s knowledge and wisdom. He admonishes his son that, while it is natural to enjoy being able to show off his powers, he must learn to be humble and keep his vanity in check.\n\nIt is surprising how little moments of restored footage such as this one seem to breathe much more life into the characters, giving them a depth not seen in their previous cinematic incarnation. And while the film is a tale of the power of good, it is ultimately a tribute to the power of love. It is love that makes Superman more vulnerable than even kryptonite, love that makes him betray his Kryptonian father\'s admonition to \"never interfere with human history\", and love that makes him truly human.\n\nThough it is nearly an hour into the film before Superman finally makes his first heroic and world-stunning appearance, it is well worth the wait. The action gets more and more exciting, rivaling anything that today\'s action counterparts, like \"The Mummy Returns\" can dish out. The effects, though antiquated by today\'s overblown CGI standards, are still impressive and manage to maintain their looks and grace in their old age. As Lex Luthor launches a diabolical plan involving hijacked twin nuclear missiles, the subsequent chase, followed by Superman\'s efforts to save an Earthquake-ravaged California, are breathtaking even by today\'s standards.\n\nLike the superhero of title, the film itself is not without its weaknesses. In trying to keep in touch with its vintage comic book roots, it can be a tad cornball at times, and occasionally gets bogged down by what I call the \"golly gee-whiz\" factor. Yet it does so in a very tongue-in-cheek manner, retaining enough adult sophistication and genuine drama to keep it from lapsing into a mere kiddy show or a parody of the source material. In fact, the film has several surprisingly mature nuances. If, like me, you hadn\'t seen this film since you were a kid, then you will be in a much better position to fully enjoy the subtleties of the film now. (i.e, Lois Lane, in her rooftop interview of Superman asks \"How big are you . . . er, I mean . .. how TALL are you\". I obviously missed that as a kid, because it had me rolling with laughter this time around.\n\nBut despite a few loose threads in the cape and tights, The Man of Steel remains quite intact and appropriately larger than life. It is therefore fitting that this film has been re-mastered and re-released in collector\'s two-sided DVD format. The sound and picture quality are excellent, wiping away the tarnish of age and making the film shine again. Some of the many features include the aforementioned restored footage (about 10-15 minutes worth), a few additional deleted scenes (which, I thought, should have been restored into the film as well), commentary by director Richard Donner, the Lois Lane screen tests, specials on the making and origins of the film, and a music-only track (well worth the price of the DVD alone).\n\nIf you haven\'t seen this movie since you were a kid, and you want to feel like a kid again, rent it now. If you\'ve never seen it at all, then the release of this DVD has taken away your last excuse. You will believe a man can fly.'),(1263,75,'7/10','Still one of the best','Groverdox','24 March 2019','The Superman movies were favourites of my childhood, but I don\'t remember them as well as many others.

Zod\" (Terence Stamp) and his co-conspirators. This all seems somewhat pointless as we soon discover that their planet is about to be decimated by it\'s nearby sun. It\'s only \"Jor-El\" and his wife \"Lara\" (Susannah York) who have the vision to build their son an escape pod and just in the nick of time launch him into space: destination Earth. Fortunately, he arrives under the very noses of the kindly Glenn Ford and Phyllis Thaxter who, after a timely demonstration of his strength, decide to adopt their foundling. Skip forward many years and we start to appreciate the frustrations this young man faces - never being able to use his powers for good (or even American football). Tragedy strikes and to the city he goes where he finds work working for the irascible \"Perry White\" (Jackie Cooper) at the renowned \"Daily Planet\". He also realises that he is now free to don his red cape, remove his geeky spectacles, and become the world\'s first flying, strong-man, super-hero. These antics attract plenty of attention - not least from his colleague \"Lois\" (Margot Kidder) and from arch crook \"Lex Luthor\" (Gene Hackman). The former wants an interview (amongst other things); the latter wants to destroy him so he can carry his out his dastardly plan to redefine the geography of California. Some solidly entertaining contributions from Ned Beatty, Valerie Perrine and Marc McClure all help the consistently under-rated Reeve to own the part with a charismatic charm and to convey a quickly paced action adventure that also allows Hackman (perhaps just a bit over-scripted) to play a fun role as a baddie with megalomanic tendencies and a brain to boot. The visual effects have held up remarkably well and though I didn\'t quite love the ending, this is a strong and confident outing for Reeve that resists the temptation to overly moralise, and delivers us an enjoyable series of good vs. Evil escapades that are well worth a few hours in front of a big screen with proper sound.'),(1268,75,'10/10','A Classic best origin story of a superhero of all time!','ivo-cobra8','24 October 2015','Superman: The Movie (1978) is the Original film and the only that is the best origin story of a Superman who changes himself into an ultimate superhero. Christopher Reeve is and always will be the only SUPERMAN! No one could play Clark Kent/Superman like Christopher Reeve, the film is still instantiate classic till it\'s day.If anyone could be Superman. It is Christopher Reeve, he fits the part perfectly as the shy yet great reporter Clark Kent, Kal-El last son of Krypton, and Superman, Earths savior from the forces of evil. It is one of my personal favorite Superman movies.\n\nSuperman is a world known icon and is permanently set in stone as the best Superhero of all time. Though, the only Superman movies I enjoyed are the first three Superman movies that had Christopher Reeve in it! This is the best superhero of the 70\'s before Marvel and DC start making superhero movies. The origin story of a man who can fly, is terrific, believable and awesome. Marlon Brando\'s role was one of his best, the most films that become memorable for me are The Godfather (1972), Apocalypse Now (1979) and this film Superman, he completed 1.year earlier this film, before he started filming Apocalypse Now (1979).\n\nWhat else can I say, that was already told? I love this film! I grew up with this film, this is the real original film which has a heart! Man of Steel (2013) reboot to Superman (1978) does not have a heart! This is the real film! The special effects are great, the CGI are barely in it, they aren\'t. The plot and the story are terrific. The cast is wonderful and acts believable. Superman and Christopher Reeve are the most beloved iconic heroes till it\'s day. For me Superman will always be Christopher Reeve no one else! I love Smallville (TV Series 2001-2011) and Tom Welling was playing young Clark Kent. Tom Welling will be Clark Kent for me, but Christopher Reeve will be Superman. Reeve also appeared in Season 2 and 3 as special guest in Smallvile which I love that so much. It is sad That Christopher Reeve died in October 10, 2004. John Williams theme score is the best score done for the character. I hear it and it makes me feel so uplifted and I feel like I can do anything. Great cast, beautiful score, and an Epic feeling that is lacking from movies in today\'s age. It is my favorite superhero film. Superman and his portrayal by Christopher Reeve is a masterpiece and is timeless . Incredible after all this time, this film still holds its own against more recent superhero films and all the CGI that goes with it. Richard Donner\'s work is a true homage to this classic hero that we have all come to love. I still get shivers when I hear the soundtrack as well.\n\nThis is a classic of the comic book hero genre, and in most respects the one that really set the standard for all comic book hero films that follow it. The special effects, sets, haircuts and wardrobe may all look dated, but Superman: The Movie remains among the most beloved films of the 1970s. Director Richard Donner brings the comic book hero to life in Christopher Reeve, who admirably adapts from the bumbling Clark Kent to the ultimate caped crusader. The entire cast is brilliant in its supporting roles. Gene Hackman gives a great performance as the unapologetically wicked Lex Luthor. And Margot Kidder delivers a portrait of a strong, ambitious Lois Lane at a time when women were starting to break the glass ceiling. But it is Donner\'s dedication to the spirit and style of the original Superman\'s comic book roots, as well as to inject a heavy dose of humor, that make Superman: The Movie a classic. In some ways, it has still not been surpassed, even by the CGI effects and faster-paced action of today\'s superhero movies.\n\nThe special effects and CGI look great and they don\'t suck. This film has a heart and it does not suck and is not bad. Marlon Brando was wonderful a touching movement performance as Jor-El, Clark\'s father. Incredible after all this time, this film still holds its own against more recent superhero films and all the CGI that goes with it. Richard Donner\'s work is a true homage to this classic hero that we have all come to love. I still get shivers when I hear the soundtrack as well.\n\nA box-office smash, an Academy Award winner* and a fan favorite since it first flew into theaters in December 1978, Superman: The Movie assembles a cast and creative contingent as only a big movie can. At its heart (just as in three sequels) is Christopher Reeve\'s intelligent, affectionate portrayal of a most human Man of Steel. Watching Superman again isn\'t just like being a kid again. It\'s better. The movie\'s legacy soared even higher when director Richard Donner revisited this beloved adventure 22 years later and integrated eight minutes into the film. Christopher Reeve, Marlon Brando (Jor-El), Gene Hackman (Luthor) and Margot Kidder (Lois Lane) give indelible performances that fuel the film\'s aura of legend.\n\nSuperman (also known as Superman: The Movie) is a 1978 superhero film directed by Richard Donner. It is based on the DC Comics character of the same name and stars Marlon Brando, Gene Hackman, Christopher Reeve, Margot Kidder, Glenn Ford, Phyllis Thaxter, Jackie Cooper, Trevor Howard, Marc McClure, Terence Stamp, Valerie Perrine, and Ned Beatty.\n\nI love this film and is the best superhero classic film ever made!!!! 10/10 it is my personal favorite Superman movie.'),(1269,75,'7/10','Miles better than the 2006 disaster!','CuriosityKilledShawn','15 March 2007','I had only ever seen the TV version of the original Superman movie until I bought the HD-DVD. So, as you can imagine, on TV it was in hideous pan and scan and with several scenes missing. In reality, I have never seen the \'full\' movie until now. And I have to admit, it\'s far, far superior to Bryan Singer\'s self-indulgent mess of Superman Returns.\n\nIt actually takes quite a while to get going, but there\'s so much going on that the running time certainly doesn\'t seem two and a half hours. Richard Donner shot it back to back with Superman II, so there\'s an extended opening act that establishes the plot of the sequel at the same time.\n\nAnyone who doesn\'t know the story of Superman must be from another galaxy, but for those people I will give you a quick soundbite. Kal El is the orphan of the planet Krypton, which has recently blown up. He comes to Earth as a baby and lands in Smallville where he is quickly adopted by a farmer and his wife and renamed Clark Kent. His dense molecular structure and his ability to defy Earth\'s gravity give him advantages over humans and ultimately he becomes...SUPERMAN! But who doesn\'t already know that?\n\nClark Kent assumes an exaggerated, clumsy, meek newspaper reporter persona to distance himself from the Superman guise. Somehow everybody, including secret love Lois Lane, falls for it even though the glasses and the hair are all that is different. Hypervillain Lex Luthor (Gene Hackman) doesn\'t take well to the man of steel as he might interfere with his plans for Real Estate Domination (the modern term for World Domination). But does he really think he can win? Hypervillains never know when to be humble.\n\nJust about everything that was terrible about Superman Returns is completely right about this one. The cinematography, the music, the editing, the pacing. I won\'t call the SFX fake, since it doesn\'t ever take you out of the film, so I\'ll just call them \'quaint\'. For 1978 they\'re good and even though they are all done optically it\'s still better than the CGI crapfest of Singer\'s interpretation.\n\nChristopher Reeve\'s ultimate fate does kind of upset me, so it\'s good to see him in his prime and being made immortal in a way. The cast of this film does have a lot of big names. Along with the huge scope and spectacle, such a large cast adds to the epic feel of it. Marlon Brando, Gene Hackman, Ned Beatty, Margot Kidder, Terence Stamp and Glenn Ford just seem like a far more dynamic bunch of actors than Kate Bosworth and Kal Penn. Don\'t you think?\n\nIt\'s been 29 years since this film was released and people still make a big fuss over it today. In 29 years, will be still be talking about Superman Returns? Outside of ridicule, I think not.'),(1270,75,'10/10','The epitome of what Superman is meant to be','mrgiggles007','21 May 2020','I still find it amazing that for over forty years, we\'ve seen countless adaptations and (mis)interpretations of Superman, and yet not one of them can even begin to compare to this masterpiece.

Movies with the \"Man of Steel\" had been made before of course, but they had mostly been cheap B-productions. And that was certainly not what the Salkinds had in mind. The father & son corporation had visions of a big-time, Hollywood extravaganza with major-name actors.\n\nFirst, they had to find a director. Ilya wanted to ask Steven Spielberg, but Alexander protested. He thought Spielberg was too busy with \"that fish movie of his\" and suggested Richard Donner instead. Since Donner just came from hit movie \"The Omen\", the younger Salkind agreed.\n\nThe first star to come on board was Marlon Brando. The fact that he was hot after winning an Oscar for \"The Godfather\" a few years earlier was reflected in his salary requests. Brando demanded (and was given) $4,5 million for the roughly 10 minutes he was in the film. To many people\'s surprise the actor refused to memorize his dialogue, instead demanding to be given his lines from cue cards behind the cameras.\n\nSuperstars like Robert Redford, Paul Newman and Sylvester Stallone were then approached to play the lead. Something they all declined. Explaining they didn\'t want to appear in front of a camera in a \"silly suit\" like that. So, the role instead went to unknown Christopher Reeves, who was contracted to make both \"Superman\" and its sequel. A deal that earnt him a paltry $250,000 for both films.\n\nTo save money, the Salkinds wanted to film \"Superman\" and \"Superman II\" simultaneously. That led to an upsetting conflict with Richard Donner, and it all ended with the director being fired. Although that in no way diminished the audience\'s interest. \"Superman\" was the number one film at the US box office for eleven weeks in a row.

I thought long and hard about what I would dedicate my 200th review to...would it be something new and flashy, a movie that I knew was a knockout, something more personal to me?? One of my faves perhaps?? I finally decided on this film.\n\nSince I was a little boy I have loved Superman. Even now many years later I am still fascinated by the character, I mean he has withstood 6 decades of changes and world upheaval and still one of the best selling heroes of our time. Without further ado let\'s talk about Richard Donner\'s big screen epic Superman: The Movie. Thanks for reading my reviews!! Superman: The Movie MUST be judged not by today\'s standards but by the standards set for films of the late seventies/early eighties. That\'s not to say that it doesn\'t stand up for itself even almost 3 decades later but it\'s true brilliance may be lost if you don\'t remember when and where it was made. Brilliant Director Richard Donner (Lethal Weapon series, The Goonies, and stocks of brilliant TV series) I think really knows what the audience wants out of characters. I\'m sure he tread on thin ice when it came to bringing the infamous Man of Steel to the big screen having only comics and TV and radio before him to base it on. Donner took everything Superman stood for, truth, justice, American Way, fighting evil, his estrangement from his home planet, his love for Lois Lane and put it all into this film.\n\nNothing is left out of Superman, we have the origins including an in depth look into Krypton (which at the time would have been a first.) We see Kal-El\'s parents and their conflicts, we are given a small introduction to Clark Kent\'s youth and his coming of age and then everything else we know and love about the Superman legend. Everything from \"The Phantom Zone\" to Lois and Clark falling in love. I always thought the casting for Superman was it\'s one downfall but after watching the film again I really see that it wasn\'t such an error in judgment.\n\nThe late and incredible Christopher Reeve truly was built for Superman. He embodied the character and created two completely different people to the point where you believed a pair of glasses and a different part in the hair was the perfect alter ego. His Clark Kent was goofy but pure and honest but completely different from the strength and character of Superman. His Superman was tall, larger than life, strong, honest, too good to be true. He was perfect and he looked both parts perfectly too and he will forever be known....in my books...as The Superman of film. Margot Kidder pretty much had Lois Lane nailed. I always thought she was a little old for the role and wasn\'t sure she looked the part but the personality was perfect, strong, forceful, pig headed, leap before you look kinda gal. And the chemistry with Reeve\'s Superman was very good. They established a fast but very bonding romance between the two characters. The supporting cast was also well done...Jackie Cooper was great as Perry White, Marc McClure was perfectly cast as the young, naive Jimmy Olsen, and Marlon Brando was an awesome screen presence for Jor-El and considering the billing he got for his brief role it\'s good that he had that pull. Gene Hackman is a brilliant actor, I\'ve loved him in many roles...he was not right for Lex Luthor or perhaps even his character wasn\'t written right. Although diabolical and evil it was done in a comedic way right down to the doofus sidekick which was more cartoonish than it was big budget film. You just didn\'t truly feel the tension and arch rivalry between Reeve and Hackman\'s characters. The only other beef I can find with Superman is the overlooking of some key elements of reality. Yes I know Superman must leave reality at the door and that\'s easy to do with such a brilliant beautifully done Epic but the whole concept of Superman reversing time by making the earth spin backwards, or turning into Superman and having his \"human\" clothes literally vanish into thin air...these are things that the writers should have looked more closely into. But I think they focused so much of their time on making sure other elements were in place that they let these things slide and that\'s okay but it\'s such a minor thing but still with such perfection in other areas they stand out.\n\nSpecial effects like this had never been seen before and they are still stunning. Watching Superman fly and the explosions and earthquake and his miracle powers are just wonderful and will forever be in the mind of movie goers. This is such a brilliant film and put a stamp on the genre of superheroes that every other film will try to live up to. For the record I am thrilled and excited about the upcoming Bryan Singer Superman film, I think he will take everything that was great about this original and utilize it to continue on the epic. Bravo to him!! Superman: The Movie also had and still has one of the most haunting, beautiful and stunning scores ever created. The music became his anthem no matter where Superman is. This is one of the best films ever, and will always be a classic especially to me!! 9/10'),(1274,75,'6/10','Superman may fly, but much of this movie is grounded in caricatures','clydestuff','1 August 2004','Before the Man of Steel hit the big screen back in the seventies, courtesy of Producer Illya Salkind, Director Richard Donner, and Warner Brothers, we were assured that we would believe a man could fly. I am not one to doubt studio promotions, but just like everybody else I was game to find out if it was so. Did I come out of Superman: The Movie believing that indeed the son of Jor-el also known as Kal-el also known as Superman also known as Clark Kent could take to the airways without benefit of plane, hot air balloon, rocket pack, or zeppelin? Nahhh...of course not, but Christopher Reeve looked a lot better faking it then any of his predecessors such as George Reeve and Kirk Alyn. The truth is that Superman: The Movie has a whole lot going for it besides the flight abilities of Reeve. It also has a multitude of things that work against it.\n\nUnless you\'re some kind of a vampire who has been locked away in a casket for the past hundred years or so, you pretty much know the story. The Planet Krypton which has a Red Sun was spinning around out there in the far reaches of space somewhere. Jor-el (Marlon Brando) had come to the conclusion that Krypton was going to explode wiping out all Kryptonians. Unable to convince anyone else of his findings, and not having a spaceship available that would carry him and Mrs. Kal-el (Susannah York), he packed up his only begotten son Kal-el along with his pampers and blasted him off towards Earth. Since Earth has a yellow sun, this would somehow increase the density of Kal-el, giving him super powers far beyond anybody but the publishers of DC comics could ever imagine. After being adopted by a farm couple known as Ma and Pa Kent (Phyllis Thaxter & Glenn Ford), Kal-el became young Clark Kent. Later in life he took a job as an ace reporter at the Daily Planet ran by Editor Perry White (Jackie Cooper), which he used as a secret identity until he was needed to get down and get funky in his identity of Superman, protector of truth, justice and the American way. It was at the Daily Planet that he met the love of his life, Ace Reporter Lois Lane (Margot Kidder). Lois had the hots for Superman too as long as he was Superman and not Clark Kent. When he was Clark, Lois wouldn\'t be caught dead in a Honeymoon Suite at Niagara Falls with him. But that\'s another story, as you well know.\n\nBefore dispensing with the well known back story, Superman opens with a sequence where three criminals are banished into The Phantom Zone in order to set up Superman II. You just have to give it props for that instead of waiting until just before the credits role to tack on the obligatory sequel setting end as most film makers have a penchant for doing. Of course it helps when you know for sure there\'s going to be a number 2 before your number one makes it onto the big screen. Marlon Brando is okay as Jor-el but I can never seem to shake the feeling that I\'m watching Brando in a white wig our forefathers would themselves have been proud to wear, and his delivery amounts to giving some kind of lecture to the Continental Congress. Krypton itself is not at all like one would imagine having read the comics, as it is displayed here as some kind of eternal homage to cubic zirconium. It\'s pretty to look at but has no substance.\n\nThis movie version doesn\'t spend much time with Clark as a boy, but they are some of the best moments in the film in spite of the fact that Jeff East who plays young Clark had his dialog dubbed by Reeve. Other than near the end of the film, it\'s the only time the film shows some real heart regarding Superman or anyone else in it. One almost hated to see Superman/Clark grow up.\n\nIn the comics that I grew up with in the sixties, Clark was always portrayed to be somewhat of a coward by Superman, in order to help protect his secret identity. In Superman: The Movie, Reeve\'s Clark is not only a \"girly man\" but is pretty much a bumbling idiot. While it strikes much more of a contrast between Clark and Superman, it is overplayed and overdone to the point that it ends up making us dread the moments when Superman does become Clark. That being said, when Reeve does put on his cape and takes flight, his portrayal as Superman is without peer.\n\nI don\'t have much of a problem with Margot Kidder\'s portrayal of Lois Lane as it seems to be right on the mark as the character was written for her. The problem is not with her characterization but not for one minute do we believe in Superman\'s sudden infatuation with her or why he is even attracted to her. The only concern Lois seems to have is where is her next big story coming from and how long it is till her next cigarette. She seems to be the epitome of a liberated woman, so the fact that she would suddenly go ga-ga over Superman doesn\'t quite hold water even if he does take time out to rescue her early in the picture, and later give her flying lessons. The relationship is never developed in a way that makes any sense at all.\n\nGene Hackman is way over the top also as Lex Luthor but at least he does it with a bit of style and fun. Not so Ned Beatty who plays his henchman Otis. Otis is supposed to be comic relief, but the only relief you\'ll get is if you pop a couple of antacids in order to be able to stomach the character. We do not for one minute believe that Lex Luther would keep a total dunce such as Otis around for any reason, as there would just have to be less excruciatingly painful criminals in Metropolis willing to run errands for him. The character of Otis is more than just an annoyance as every scene he is in drags the story down to a mediocre level. Valerie Perrine\'s Miss Teschmacher is kind of a dumb bulb also, but her character is at least kept in check to the point where she is even likeable. And alas, just as most of the characters are in this film, Perry White is played by Jackie Cooper as a simple minded goof ball.\n\nWhat is good about Superman are the flying sequences. As a matter of fact when Superman is zooming around performing various rescues ranging from a cat to a president and capturing criminals, the film as a whole takes flight. The special effect all around are well done, especially Superman\'s rescue of Lois from a helicopter, and later as he races around California to repair the damage being done during an Earthquake. The scenes where he takes to the sky with Lois for a romantic interlude are almost lyrical.\n\nJohn Williams give us another one of his no holds bar musical scores. Its well done for this kind of film, and apparently the producers and director thought so too as it plays over top of some of the longest running opening and closing film credits known to man. In other words, when the film starts you\'ll have plenty of time to still pop another batch of popcorn, run to the bathroom and make it back to your recliner before we come close to reaching the planet Krypton.\n\nBesides Otis, the biggest problem with Superman: The Movie comes near the end. In order to resolve a plot situation which if left as it was would have caused major problems for the subsequent sequel, the writer, director or somebody has Superman perform a stunt that reeks of lazy film making. It opens a plot hole as wide and as deep as the Grand Canyon. Usually in a film based on a comic book character, one can overlook such devices, but this one is so glaring and obvious in its ineptitude that it one will be forced to mumble a certain word pertaining to bull droppings. I haven\'t felt this cheated since my first girlfriend dumped me for another guy.\n\nSuperman: The Movie is highly watchable in many aspects. With a little more thought and consideration in how to bring the classic characters to the screen, it could have been one of the great comic book films of all time. Unfortunately, when you can only make me think of what might have been or could have been, I have no choice but to give you my grade which for Superman: The Movie is a C+.'),(1275,75,'7/10','Pretty good','preppy-3','8 May 2000','One of the better comic book movies. The story is vague (something about Lex Luthor causing California to sink into the ocean), but the movie holds your interest. The acting is mostly good--Reeve is perfect as Superman, Margot Kidder is OK as Lois Lane, Gene Hackman is fun as Luthor, but Valerie Perrine and Ned Beatty are just annoying. The script is a problem--some times it\'s funny, other times it\'s horrible. It was also obviously written \"down\" for the kids in the audience. Also there are lapses in logic and the special effects are pretty laughable. Still, I was never bored and the acting by Reeve and the music score by John Williams carry you through the bad sections. Worth watching--perfect for the entire family. Try to see it letter-boxed though--it doesn\'t work on full-screen TV.\n8 out of 12 found this helpful. Was this review helpful?

Carefully adapted from the popular DC Comics character created by Joe Shuster and Jerry Siegel, Richard Donner\'s 1978 epic has stood the test of time to become the supreme superhero film. Alongside Tim Burton (\"Batman\") and Sam Raimi (\"Spider-Man\"), Donner earned his place in cinematic history by becoming the first director to make a perfect superhero film. Superman is the most recognizable comic book superhero in history, and when Clark Kent (the late, great Christopher Reeve) rips open his shirt to reveal that symbolic \"S\" an hour and 11 minutes into the film, you know that it\'s one of the greatest cinematic moments. This epic defined the superhero film, and in the 27 years since its release, every subsequent comic book superhero movie is forever indebted to \"Superman.\" The plot (and what a plot) runs complete throughout its epic 154 minutes and believe me, there\'s not a single wasted moment in the film\'s entire running length. Of course, Clark Kent is sent from his dying home world of Krypton by his father Jor-El (the late Marlon Brando), grows up and works at the Daily Planet, falls in love with Lois Lane (Margot Kidder), and must foil the diabolical plans of Lex Luthor (Gene Hackman). Put simply, there will never be another movie like \"Superman,\" and who can forget those *cosmic* credits, the aforementioned \"S\" scene, the Superman and Lois date over New York City and later above the clouds, and that one, definitive climax when Superman lets out a painful cry that reveals that one glint of humanity that he\'s earned from his time on earth. Reeve will forever be linked to the role that really made people believe he was a super man, even when he wasn\'t wearing the blues, reds, and yellows, and was instead confined to the prison that\'s called a wheelchair. But we know that he\'s up there, flying high with the Almighty and proving to us all that he is who we believed he was. The recent news that Bryan Singer (\"X-Men\") is directing a new Superman is not exactly getting me giddy, considering the low standards of today\'s film-making and the onslaught of CGI effects that dominate many Hollywood action movies these days.

Superman is portrayed as a Christ-like figure throughout and many scenes contain subtext on this theme.\n\nThe opening sequence is as strong as any great sci-fi movie with Crypton brought memorably to life and featuring a famous cameo from the great Marlon Brando as Superman\'s natural father. Brando\'s godlike presence helps to convince you that the son he sends to Earth is going to be someone quite special.\n\nSuperman has another Hollywood legend in Glen Ford as his adopted father. Ford was equally as naturalistic an actor as Brando but he brings a more human (no pun intended) and slightly lower-key presence to the second stage of Superman\'s life. This part of the movie contains some of the best cinematography with its rural landscapes. One image of a train running along a track above a cornfield is one of many beautiful sequences.\n\nBoth parts of the movie mentioned above serve the origin purpose of the character and finish quite emotionally. After about an hour I found myself ready for a change of pace and tone, which is exactly what we get as we meet a fully grown Superman and his alter ego Clark Kent in the big city of Metropolis.\n\nWhat follows is almost like a different movie. It is funny, action packed and contains superb performances from Christopher Reeve and Margot Kidder who have excellent chemistry. Reeve is so perfect for the roles of Superman/Clark that one of the reasons later incarnations of the character never worked for me was that he could never be replaced. He looks like the comic book drawing of the character and effortlessly switches between the two versions of the man. Kidder is not your typical leading lady with her husky, smokers voice and ultra confident personality but is the perfect foil for Reeve in Kent mode.\n\nGene Hackman steals the show whenever he appears on screen making homicidal, megalomaniac Lex Luthor not only funny but feel like a credible antagonist to a virtually indestructible superhero. Ned Beatty and Valerie Perrine provide solid support as his criminal sidekicks.\n\nAll of the above performances and the casting decisions made are a massive part of what makes the film last so well and compete in today\'s market where superhero movies reign supreme.\n\nThe special effects were epic in their day but are slightly dated now. Particularly the flying scenes and some shots where scale models can be easily spotted. However some hold up as well as any, such as the Crypton visuals and the helicopter sequence.\n\nThe great John Williams wrote another fabulous score and in particular Superman\'s main theme is an unforgettable piece of music. My four year old daughter heard it once and was humming the tune for days.\n\nI can only imagine what a breath of fresh air Superman must have been on its release. The seventies was a renaissance decade for American cinema but a lot of it came with too much depressing realism. Superman did not showcase quite the same standard of spectacle as Star Wars, but it was far less centred around violence and with it Richard Donner kicked off the superhero genre.'),(1279,75,'7/10','In essence, one of the better films of its ilk that I\'ve seen and a throughly effective romp on several fronts.','johnnyboyz','15 June 2013','Here\'s a novelty: a big budgeted, English language superhero film which is actually pretty damn good; a film that knows how to have fun - a film that knows how to depict people and their actions, rather than just depict action and have the people sort of fill into the frame. At its core is an interesting hero; a strong villain, a good love interest and some imagery that is genuinely powerful. To an extent, it is a love story but it is its strange concoction of romance; screwball comedy and horror that makes the film so appealing. We\'ve seen films many times before with plots at the centre of them revolving around evil people attempting to destroy the world (or at least part of it)– when we see it here, we don\'t mind it so much out of how well the film nails all of the other stuff. Take a scene much later on when the villain outlines his plan to our hero, a scene which is cruelly undercut with the villain\'s hapless sidekick attempting to muscle in by staking his own claim on things. Angry at his minion\'s grab for glory, he berates him, and continues his threats. Such a sequence, while featuring in a film buried deep within a canon of American cinema from an era when treating terrorism as one big joke was the norm, encapsulates perfectly the deftness of director Richard Donner\'s ability to hop between genres and codes and yet still maintain an eye on the prize.\n\nWe begin as if the whole thing was one large soap opera set on another planet entirely, furthermore located within another solar system and playing out to an entirely different set of social dynamics. A being known as Jor-El (Brando) is busy addressing matters in relation to the punishment of three of his own species whose ideas of inter-planetary mutiny are scorned upon. Once that has been dealt with, we learn that this planet, named Krypton, is millions of years ahead of Earth in its spiritual and technological development in spite of the fact its general inflection reminds us of ancient Greece. Perhaps that is the point. Despite these advancements in years, the people thereon are unable to tell the difference between a \"routine orbital shift\" and their own planet\'s destruction. When the planet does destroy itself, it kills all who inhabit it but for Jor-El\'s son Kal-El - someone who is ejected from the planet and crash lands on that of Earth in the 1950\'s. He grows up to become the titular Superman under the homo-sapien guise of Clark Kent, played by Christopher Reeve.\n\nBut Donner is still far from playing his hand. Before an adult Clark ends up as a newshound in the fictitious metropolis of. Metropolis, there are some amusing sequences set in an additionally fictional locale named Smallville, a small rural town set in an unspecified state, although most likely shot in New Mexico. It is during this stretch that Clark grows up with his adopted parents; shrugs off bullies; feels aggrieved that he doesn\'t get a girlfriend and hides his extraordinary powers made possible through Earth\'s gravitational sciences in comparison to his home planet\'s. These segments might very well have inspired a film all on their own: the ultimate concept piece of a superhero from beyond the stars stuck with an (un)enviable ability to boot a football the length of a the pitch lest he join he football team when he isn\'t out-running an express train lest he partake in high school track and field. Years later, in 2008, director Peter Berg produced \"Hancock\" whereby the central idea read something along the lines that a human-like creature with Superman-esque powers was stuck on planet Earth but kept falling afoul of everyone out of his mismanagement of them.\n\nIt is Metropolis wherein things take shape in this young man\'s life, someone who infiltrates a newspaper Bureau as a typist whose off screen speed and ability to do such a thing impresses an editor. Reporter Lois Lane (Kidder) adopts the role of the love interest, somebody besotted by Superman when he saves her life but oblivious to Clark Kent\'s actual attraction to her. These scenes carry such weight in dynamism that it\'s difficult not to enjoy them, with the idea that Clark is trapped in Earthly conditions alien to him combining with the fact the film is essentially the tale of a farmhand coming-good in the big city with an unrequited love to boot. It makes for wonderful viewing and there is a real flair and energy behind these scenes that is never sugary nor overdone.\n\nGene Hackman\'s villain, Lex Luthor, is one of the slimier \'event movie\' villains; not someone especially brash and quite obviously insane, but someone whose introduction is both at once funny and sadistic and whose on screen presence merely carries on from there. While in no way a physical match for Superman, the fascination lies with observing a twisted, criminally opportunistic Earth brain going up against extra-terrestrial brawn. It isn\'t good enough to have these two people merely meet up and slug it out: it would be a no-contest. They must, therefore, speak and match one another verbally – something which requires skill in the writing and patience in the viewer. This is a really romping, cracking adventure depicting people meeting; bonding; clashing and ultimately dealing with one another, a film that allows the bad guys to occasionally win; the superhero to appear vulnerable and is assertive enough to take its time (through its runtime) in dealing with characters regardless of what its audience\'s attention span may be. If there were more films of this nature that were of this nature, the multiplex would be a nicer place to frequent.'),(1280,75,'departed07','Christopher Reeve Will Be Missed','11 October 2004','Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.','I thought I would pay tribute to one of Christopher\'s Reeve\'s best role ever; and that role is Superman. As many comic book fans follow, the film tells the story of Clark Kent who was born on Krypton and was transported into Earth after the planet exploded and loses his real family. As a new family finds him in the field going home, the couple take Clark as their own son and raise him. What the couple know about Clark is that he has a gift to do things twice as fast than any other ordinary human being; but as time goes by, Clark loses his father of a stroke and decides to take a life of his own as he works for the Metropoltian Newspaper, he meets Lois Lane (Margot Kidder) and he has a crush on her, even saving the woman from being killed. Just like any comic book movie, there is always a villain; with Gene Hackman as Lex Luthor in a campy role along with Ned Beatty as Otis, the sycophant with no sense, these two plan to destroy the world with nuclear weapons. Christopher Reeve doesn\'t get into the Superman Costume until 45 minutes into the film in which he saves Lois in one scene, busts bad guys and becomes and icon to the public. Superman is the finest comic book movie, and I only wish Christopher Reeve\'s family the best.\n73 out of 95 found this helpful. Was this review helpful?

People want different things out of a movie and John Wick 4 delivers exceptionally well in certain areas while being mediocre in others.\n\nA quick summary is I had a fking great time watching it at some points and a little bored during others. The action scenes are fantastic. It\'s a TON of fun and really cool to watch. A little towards the middle of the film it did feel a bit slow and dragged out. Cutting out 15 mins would be perfect.\n\nHeld up by good action and decent laughs is the weak story. I absolutely LOVE the idea of the underground black market, the continentals, and the high table. I wish we got to see more of that world. I wanted more backstory, more exposure, more display of how they ran behind the scenes. Hopefully I\'ll get to see that in the Ballerina and Continental.\n\nThe other thing I think hindered the movie was that the idea of the high table got watered down. They started off as some serious group that mean business that you don\'t want to mess with. In John Wick 4 I felt like they were kind of a joke and not really as big as mean as people made them out to be. John Wick was just so broken in the 4th chapter. I know it\'s the whole appeal of John Wick but it does take away from the story and suspense when, even with suspension of disbelief, is just pure absolute absurdity. But that\'s also why I love it!\n\nI swear John Wick can take more hits than some Avengers. He\'s like a tank with the body of Wolverine.\n\nBut regardless of what you\'re looking for you have to give it to the crew for how much work and dedication they put in to this movie. The quality really shows here. It\'s just really fun and exciting to watch. I rate it higher than the other John Wick films even though it\'s not my favorite just because in 9 out of 10 ways it\'s bigger and better.\n\nBut I love the other John Wick films because we got more backstory, more Continental, and more focus on story.'),(1282,77,'9/10','Yeah','markvanwasbeek','23 March 2023','By now you know what to expect from a John Wick movie. I thought the franchise was losing a little momentum in chapter 3 so I was worried this could be disappointing. It\'s not. It\'s even more on steroids than any Wick before! Even close to 3 hours it doesn\'t feel to long which is very special for a action movie. This franchise has set new standards. If anybody says a movie is good like John Wick, it better f\'n be! The set pieces as everyone mentioned before are really insane this time. The Tokyo sceney with illuminated cherry blossoms was beautiful. The only super illogical thing that bothered me was that nobody flinched at the nightclub, eventually they did but after a whole 10 minute beatdown through the whole club, but then again it\'s a shady nightclub for high table people.

The John Wick franchise is one of the few exceptions, along with Mission Impossible. These franchises keep getting better with every entry. Hollywood can make action masterpieces, but Marvel has greater demand, so that\'s what we get most of. It\'s a shame.\n\nThe stunts and choreography are beyond impressive. Every artist involved does their job to perfection. Donnie Yen\'s performance is unbelievable. Not only does he fight great, but he also has to move like a blind man. Keanu Reeves is also very impressive. Keanu IS John Wick. Although there are a few scenes where his enemies stand by and wait for their turn to attack, it\'s easy to overlook because everything else is so great.\n\nI can\'t fathom how anyone could choose to watch Ant-Man over John Wick. It\'s so fast-paced, and the choreography and stunts are mesmerizing and brutal. When the action breaks out, it\'s unbelievable. It\'s hard to explain -- you have to see it!

It was somewhat of a comeback for the legendary Keanu Reeves and reinvigorated the action genre. Since then it\'s become THE action juggernaut franchise. Now we are on number 4 and while usually things get redone with that amount of sequels, this film innovates and thrills to new heights in an absolute epic.\n\nOne of the most surprising aspects of this particular entry, is the story being written as well as it is. Something that is hard to come by in the genre at times. Not saying the others in the franchise weren\'t but this is easily the best story diving deeper in the high table aspects as well as John Wick\'s true emotions . The rich characterization is also at its best with outstanding additions like Skaarsgard, and even more screen time for supporting greats like Fishburne to compliment the magnificent Reeves. RIP Lance Reddick. It\'s nice to have such substance amongst the endless high octane ballistic visuals.\n\nSpeaking of ballistic, this movie goes more all out than any I\'ve seen for insanely well crafted choreographed shootout and fight scenes. Just when you thought you\'ve seen it all, Stahelski/Reeves prove their action minds are ever evolving. These guys were born to make action movies together.\n\nThe extremely vibrant colors and plethora of locations is also a feast for the eyes. The sharp atmospheric imagery creates the ultimate backdrop for not only the action but also just the dialogue. The sound is also top notch and perfectly compliments the intensity. It\'s just an absolute sensory journey that you don\'t get in too many action films aside from the Wick genre.\n\nOverall the limitless and outrageous action alone is nothing like we\'ve seen before for the genre or just cinema in general . But also this rich unique story may only build Wick\'s timeless character for more films in the future which at this momentum will be welcomed.'),(1286,77,'6/10','If you enjoy watching other people play video games...','blackknight-51234','4 November 2023','If you enjoy watching other people play video games then you\'ll definitely enjoy this.\n\nThere\'s lots of action, weapons and style - all the things we\'ve come to expect from a John Wick film.\n\nOf course it\'s ridiculous - all of them are. The mere idea that you can deflect bullets with a jacket lapel gives you an indication of how far from reality this film is. Keanu Reeves sustains what would be critical injuries half a dozen times - and shakes it off without any ill effects.\n\nWith one exception, the amount of damage a character can sustain appears to be directly related to how important they are to the story. Most of the victims in the extensive gun battles (at one point it appears Keanu Reeves is single-handedly depopulating Paris) are gone after a couple of shots. If you have a speaking part then you can take much more damage than any of the extras.\n\nThe whole idea of the \"secret assassin society\" only works if you don\'t draw attention to yourself\". So having a full blown Blackwater Contracting reunion at the Arc de Triumph isn\'t exactly the best way of keeping things on the down low.\n\nThrow in a Mr Chow-esque (from the hangover) character and then deciding to make him blind really shows how silly things have got. Last time I checked, gunfighting requires you to be able to at least the person you want to shoot. That said, he is at least still more convincing than Ruby Rose was.\n\nThe first John Wick film was such a hit because the audience felt a connection with his loss and wanted him to be successful seeking revenge on what were some nasty (if ineffective) bad guys. At this point I\'m not really sure what John Wick is supposed to be fighting for. He just lurches from one noir styled location to the next before embarking on an unrestrained killing spree, leaving dozens dead in his wake - you wonder if these people have families.\n\nIf you liked the second and/or third film, then you\'ll like this. It requires little to no thought and the plot is as by the numbers as you\'d expect.\n\nThat said, the action, although resembling a video game, is very well shot, there\'s lots of cool locations and stylish outfits. Despite the tactical nonsense and the fact that the bad guys wait in line for their turn to attack him, Keanu Reeves has genuine skill in martial arts and pistol shooting.\n\nIt\'s as constructive a use of time as playing 3 hours of Call Of Duty in your best suit.'),(1287,77,'9/10','A new standard has been set for fight scenes','FeastMode','24 March 2023','Half of this review will be me gushing about the action. Wow. Just wow. I was in complete awe. There were multiple times I was both tearing up and laughing at how unbelievably amazing the fight scenes are. Now this is nothing new for the John Wick series. But for me, this is far and away the best action of the entire series.\n\nI\'m an action junkie and am repeatedly disappointed with action movies and their terrible fight scenes, filled with shaky cam, quick cuts and close-up shots (looking at you Snake Eyes and Mortal Kombat). Then I watch a John Wick movie and feel so spoiled, while also being baffled at why other action movies can\'t learn from this. The fights are so fast-paced yet completely clear and easy to follow.\n\nThere is every kind of fighting imaginable. So many weapons, styles, chases, vehicles, animals, everything. So much creativity with the kills. Amazing combinations of weaponry and fighting styles (pistol/sword combo is my fave).\n\nThe music is awesome as usual, maybe even a step up. It enhances every action scene. The cinematography is pristine. So many beautiful shots, so many mesmerizing locations for the action. It is stylistically beautiful.\n\nThere are a couple of scenes that are shot in such a creative way that I\'ve never seen before. One is an overhead shot one-take that I couldn\'t believe. It takes the movie to a new level. So many scenes feel like they\'re a video game brought to life. Numerous times it feels like the VR game Pistol Whip.\n\nDonnie Yen is awesome. End of paragraph.\n\nAbout an hour into this nearly 3-hour movie, I felt like I experienced enough action amazingness for an entire movie. I was in a state of ecstasy. Not only was this looking like the best of the series, I started wondering if this would be a landmark action flick. Maybe it\'s my own fault for setting expectations so high mid-movie, but the second half is more flawed, though still awesome.\n\nThe subplot with the tracker doesn\'t seem at all consequential. And his dog attacks were already done, and better, with Halle Berry in Parabellum. A few of the issues I had with Parabellum pop up again, like overdoing it sometimes with the damage he takes. For example, instead of getting hit by one car, he gets hit by three cars. And that\'s a mild example. Also, it\'s fairly anticlimactic.\n\nEven with those flaws, I had a BLAST with this movie and will definitely see it at least once more in theaters. Seeing it on a premium screen is a must. Loudest speakers, biggest screen. TRUST ME.\n\nEDIT: I was itching to go again since opening night. I wasn\'t able to wait more than 5 days. On second viewing, I still felt the same flaws, but I didn\'t care. The action is incredible. It has at least four* of my all-time favorite action scenes. I want to watch these scenes a hundred times.\n\nIt\'s definitely not perfect, but I still consider it an action landmark (last time I said that was Mad Max: Fury Road). Every other action movie should learn from this. Updating rating from 8 to 9 stars.\n\n(5 viewings, opening Thursday UltraScreen 3/23/2023, UltraScreen 3/28/2023, SuperScreen 4/10/2023, re-issue IMAX 5/2/2023, 9/22/2023)'),(1288,77,'8/10','May possibly be the best John Wick, but is absolutely the most John Wick.','Brandon_Walker_Robinson','17 March 2023','That lasted 169 minutes? I had no idea. The time just flew right by.\n\nChad Stahelski does not pull any punches (or engage the safety) at any time in this gun-fu epic. Combat scenes are not moments so much as they are entire acts. The amount of stunt choreography that everybody had to synchronize to was rather incredible, and they continue to find more ways to entertain us with kills, kill types, use of weapons, locations, teamwork, etc. I caught myself smiling for minutes on end several times while watching it.\n\nOf course though, as I said, they really lean into it. I\'m sure this has been true of previous films as well, but it is very apparent that John Wick should virtually die in every scene that he is in. Whether it is how he is attacked or how they fail to attack him at the right times, he goes at every foe like the bear in The Revenant with full adrenaline and no signs of slowing down no matter what he is hit by. And again, I think if you look hard enough you will find enemies who have clear shots and choose not to take them because of plot armor, but you can forgive it enough if you\'re rewarded with a longer take or overall longer action sequence. What I really loved was how many of these scenes took place at night with dazzlingly lit environments all around, and the music in every scene kicks as much *** as what you see on screen. I had pondered over why John Wick doesn\'t have a video game yet, but if they ever make one I have decided I\'d like one of those top-down shooter games (similar to The Hong Kong Massacre, and if not maybe like the GTA:SA MP rampage style).\n\nI acknowledge this franchise for what it is now, but I still pine for some of the missing components that I don\'t know if it\'ll ever be able to bring back. After watching John Wick, fun as it was, I found myself interested in seeing a prequel when he was the Baba Yaga in his prime, taking missions rather than being hunted. Even still, at least in that movie he was absolutely feared. In Chapter 2, I still found him heavily respected, but it was in that movie that I realized there would probably be a repetitive formula to the narrative and movie/action structure (which still has yet to break). In Chapter 3, there only lived assassins and they would go after him without hesitation, which did is not how I felt the world breathed the first time around. They continue down this path in Chapter 4, while opening the universe more to different characters breeding their own kind of loyalty. They are all insanely fun to watch, and you see the cogwheels of the John Wick universe spinning with the future Continental television show and the Ballerina movie spinoff. Where they remain faulty though is even with the existence of civilians during fight scenes, they act as droning NPC\'s like nothing is happening around them, or they aren\'t there whatsoever. It is clear that this is not our world that this movie takes place in, but rather a parallel one.\n\nI mentioned the introduction of new characters in this world, and you can\'t not bring up Donnie Yen when talking about them. He steals each and every scene that he is in, and it\'s crazy because you wonder how a character like his could thrive in such a world but you absolutely believe it when you watch it. I will absolutely take more of him and Rina Sawayama. She isn\'t featured as much, but she makes use of every second that she is in front of the camera. There are plenty of others (such as the great Hiroyuki Sanada), but the point remains that Wick is relegated to this greater universe with characters who-good, bad, or for themselves-are ones we can actually root for in any fight. Keanu Reeves is understandably less nimble at his age than the others (and it\'s either bad acting or he really has taken on this John Wick role in his line delivery to hilarious new heights), but he and Stahelski have found a groove that still makes him the most impenetrable force around, to the point that I go back and watch the action scenes in The Matrix Resurrections and wonder what happened there. I didn\'t love one particular character in their big fighting moment(s), but they go for versatility and I have to give them that much.\n\nMarch has had an incredible run of theatrical films, and John Wick: Chapter 4 is no different. You will lean forward during the action which there is plenty, and if I\'m one to go off of you will not feel the runtime. There is an end credits scene as well if you\'re able to stay for a moment longer. I would love to go back and see this one again.'),(1289,77,'10/10','The bad reviews are right again...','destinychild2014','19 March 2023','I never read the good reviews in anything.

Despite being filmed in the 90s, Jurassic Park continues to be a classic to this day. Watching the movie now highlights the contrast between the effects then and the special effects available now. This, along with some acting that is a tad overdone, are the only real critiques I would give this film.

Another extremely influential aspect of this film is the music that plays over certain intense scenes and the iconic theme music in the opening/closing. The music combined with the diegetic sound of the dinosaur stomping/approaching builds the suspense and creates an intense tension in the audience. As a classic worldwide, it\'s no wonder that this movie provided the basis for generations of movies to follow.\n45 out of 47 found this helpful. Was this review helpful?

So, in the case of mega-hits where there is a strong consensus that the movie is exceptional (and I don\'t disagree), what more is there to say?! Apart from a few characters who seemed a bit one-dimensional (which is a minor problem in an action film) and the unwritten Spielberg rule that kids cannot die (taking away much of the suspense), the film is amazing. While the CGI isn\'t quite as beautiful as what we can do today, it STILL looks awesome. With only a few exceptions, the dinosaurs LOOK real! And, the music from John Williams is, as expected, very good. Overall, a highly entertaining film which will no doubt please everyone except for the impossible to please.\n61 out of 72 found this helpful. Was this review helpful?

True, it is the fourth highest grossing movie ever (for the time being) and was a motion picture bible for eight-year-olds across the country, but it has never been regarded as artistically superior. When, in reality, it is one of the most artistically inventive movies ever. It contains all of Spielberg\'s magical strokes of genius from fantastic art direction and wonderful camera techniques to astounding technical quality ( which comes from his well known control over technology). The minor flaws of a theme park are masterfully embedded into the art direction, script etc. and the acting is superb. This is one of the only movies I\'ve seen with great acting by children. Spielberg\'s camera usage ranges from foreshadowing the appearance of dinosaurs with extreme up-angles to exquisitely composed scenes of the dinosaurs\' \"interaction\" with the characters. Aside from technical quality, Jurassic Park bears powerful social messages of human intrusion and destruction of natural environment and the self-revering nature of man. Also, it had an undeniable effect on cinema being one of the first movies to use CGI at such a large scale. However, the most ingenious aspect of the film is the portrayal of the dinosaurs as animals rather than ruthless monsters. At many times throughout the movie, the humans are portrayed as antagonists and the respect and appreciation of the dinosaurs is wonderfully developed. And, best of all, like star wars you can analyze the movie all you want or just sit back and enjoy the ride.'),(1297,78,'10/10','The Movie to define a Generation.','josiahliljequist','11 June 2019','If you were born in the 90s or before, you had a connection with people...you absolutely loved this movie, and it made a mark on you.

I remember that it was the first pg-13 movie I was allowed to watch, and what a way to start my grown up movie experience!!! Everything in this movie screams adventure, from the opening scene where the jungle leaves rustle, the shot of mysterious sparkling amber, to the landing of the helicopter on a remote rainforest island, the movie sets the tone for the greatest adventure movie ever made. As you hear John Williams glorious theme start to swell, and you see Alan remove his glasses and start to tremble, you know you\'re about to witness one of the most magical moments ever put on cinema. I can\'t go into detail on all the incredible scenes, from the T-Rex reveal, to the kitchen scene, but each one of them revolutionized what we thought movie magic could take us.

Never before 1993 had dinosaurs been so breathtaking and realistic on the silver screen.\n\nThe plot is very original. A group of scientists cloned dinosaurs, and are about to open an amusement park where people can see the dinosaurs. The creator John Hammond(Richard Attenborough) invites a group of people, along with his grandchildren, to see the dinos and enjoy a relaxing time at the park. Could anything go wrong, at the time it doesn\'t seem like it, but something else is going on. Employee Dennis Nedry is planning to steal dinosaur embryos. In order to do this, he causes a security breakdown so he can get the embryos and escape. He isn\'t the only one that can escape, as hungry dinos also escape. After this, everyone on the island is in danger, and loose dinosaurs are everywhere. That is where the fun in Jurassic Park comes in.\n\nThis is an underrated movie according to the IMDb ratings. It isn\'t even in the top 250. Today, people don\'t appreciate it as much, mainly due to the fact that other movies like it have been made. Growing up in the 90\'s, this was one of my favorite movies. As a kid, I only watched it to see the dinosaurs, as I didn\'t understand a whole lot of it. Today, I realize how great the plotting and suspense are.\n\nThis spawned two sequels. The second one wasn\'t bad, but the third wasn\'t very good. I would recommend seeing the second after this, but the third is passable.\n\nThe story is great, how at first we see how the magic was created, and then later we see the magic turn into a disaster, in which everyone\'s life is at stake.\n\nThe special effects are still good today, but they were revolutionary for back in 1993. The acting is good, and the ensemble cast is great. All of the action sequences are perfectly executed, creating plenty of suspense and tension.\n\nYounger kids may get scared by this, as I remember a lot of young kids being scared by it in 1993. If kids aren\'t scared by dinosaurs, they will probably enjoy the movie.\n\nI highly recommend Jurassic Park. It is quite underrated in my opinion, it deserves more credit than it gets.\n\nWatch this at all costs if you have somehow missed it and see what everyone was amazed about back in 1993.\n\nEnjoy'),(1299,78,'10/10','A rare breed of film seldom seen anymore: a true masterpiece.','Pjtaylor-96-138044','10 June 2018','\'Jurassic Park (1993)\' is a landmark achievement, in as many ways as possible. While some of the exclusively digital dinosaurs don\'t hold up quite as well as the rest (despite having been only relatively recently surpassed by their peers - depending on budgetary constraints, of course), there are times when the superb CG almost seamlessly blends with possibly the best practical effects I\'ve ever seen to create phenomenally believable, groundbreaking special-effects that truly are, still to this day, some of the best of their kind. Seriously, both the Raptor rigs and, specifically, the to-scale T-Rex are nothing short of breathtaking. They work so well not only due to the flick\'s fantastic technical prowess but also thanks to its beautiful blending of its core techniques (those created by clay and those by computer), its legitimate reactions from the compelling characters and its uncanny ability to put the audience right in the middle of it all, making you feel genuine wonder, fear, suspense and elation as if you\'re really sat alongside these long-extinct creatures. It\'s difficult to stress just how important the characters are in making it all so utterly believable, as well as so utterly captivating. Each of them feel like fleshed-out people, written to perfection by screenwriters who know how to get information across to the audience in a very organic way. It\'s almost as entertaining watching these people just converse with one another, discussing the morals of bringing extinct creatures back from the dead, as it is seeing them navigate the survival situation in which they are inevitably placed. It is only because we care so much about all the core players that the suspense sequences work so well, that we are kept on the edge of our seat every time a dinosaur lurks around the corner and that we grip our chairs when they leap for their prey. These scenes are some of the best in cinema, perfectly constructed with restraint and splendour. It\'s also difficult to describe how affecting even the simple moments can be, the moments in which we are asked to sit back and stare at the mere sight of a dinosaur. These should have dampened with time and yet they haven\'t, still eliciting the awe they did when they first hit the big-screen. They emulate the imagined magic of seeing one of these animals in real life for the first time. Running underneath all of this are some compelling themes that eagerly invite analysis, with the central debate being a tough and intriguing one. The picture is simply one of the most engaging I\'ve ever seen, one that puts an ear-to-ear smile on your face just because it\'s so utterly amazing. It balances all of its core tenants impeccably, being a proper \'summer blockbuster\' that\'s incredibly intelligent as well, to the point that every second is just supreme entertainment. It can make you lean forward in your seat or well-up with awe and, in general, have a blast from beginning to end. The movie is, without a doubt, a true masterpiece. 10/10'),(1300,78,'10/10','incredible movie','STACorpus','4 October 2005','Even though it was adapted from a book, this unique story was destined to become an incredible film.

It also contains some scenes that are instant classics, such as the first time they see the dinosaurs, the kitchen scene with the raptors, the end scene with the raptors and the T-Rex, the scene with the T-Rex and the kids in the jeep, and of course the scene where the T-Rex chases the jeep.

Maybe it was the utter amazement when I first saw the Brachiosaurus eat from a tree. Or maybe it was my adrenaline rushing when two 12 year old were attacked by velociraptors. It might possibly be the chills that went down my spine when the T-Rex first made his terrifying roar. Whatever it was, it made me write this review.\n\nAllan Grant (Sam Neil) and Ellie (Laura Dern) are two successful paleontologists who are asked by a rich man John Hammond to come at his park for a major tour. They agree and are taken to an island where \"Jurassic Park\" logos are everywhere. The two paleontologists have no idea what they are getting themselves into. The first dinosaur to make an apearance is the Brachiosaurus, which both of them are extrememly amazed by its giant apearance, and so is the audience. What the two of them don\'t know is that there are much more terrifying and carnivorous dinosaurs who are about to escape and run loose....\n\nDirected by the mighty Steven Speilberg, Jurassic Park relied on more character development than any other creature-feature. Usually you get second-rate actors who can\'t act, getting terrified by monsters that don\'t really exist. Jurassic Park was the opposite. It changed the way we looked at the world, and it will forever. Based on the novel by Micheal Crichton, Jurassic Park was an amazing movie.\n\nFrom beginning to end, Jurassic Park bedazzled us with dinosaurs. Dinosaurs that are EXTINCT. There are a lot of cool cameos and the stars give great performances. The whole family should watch this movie. Not for the glossy title, but because of the dinosaurs. I remember being a kid when I first watched it, and I remember loving this movie so bad. The climax was excellent, and I am not saying what happens, unlike the sequel to this film (Jurassic Park 3). A climax-less bad film, that was. But this....this was magic. And yes, it was a masterpiece.\n\nThe magic of this film is what brought me into dinosaurs, too. I had a \"Jurassic Park\" marathon today and I watched this movie, and I can still feel the magic. You will feel the magic too once you see it. I just have absolutely nothing to say except that Steven Speilberg will put a spell on you. Even if you don\'t like creature-features, this movie will entertain you. Steven Speilberg will take you to places that no one else ever will. And the \"life will find a way\" speech is here, ready to make someone feel that creating dinosaurs that have been extinct for millions of years is a good thing.\n\nAbsolutely needless to say, Jurassic Park was a golden diamond.\n\n10/10 (One of the greatest films ever made)'),(1302,78,'10/10','Groundbreaking!','stephie-12','26 February 2004','This was obviously the most sophisticated portrayal of dinosaurs at the time, and it doesn\'t age a bit.

These are no animatronic animals but dinosaurs that are created to live and breath the air of man. As usual their is a dark side to every fantasy and the dream is threatened when the park systems break down, all hell breaks loose leaving the tourists and workers left for survival.

I was eleven when I read the book, but all the technical stuff lost me and I never finished it. A couple years later when I heard the movie was coming out, I decided I would just see it instead. With advance tickets selling out fast, my mom was lucky enough to get some a few days before it\'s premiere. We stood in line for roughly thirty minutes before we finally got in. Even as the lights were dimming, I still had no idea what to expect. Within moments I was glued to my seat. The opening sequences remains one of my favorite scenes in any film and continues to give me goosebumps to this day. For the next two hours, I sat in my seat just staring at the screen as these marvelous, life-like creatures that were unlike anything I had ever seen before. The film was full of awe and scares. I walked out of the theater virtually trying to catch my breath. What a thrill ride the film had been, and I eventually went back and saw it a few more times. The film was a turning point in my life, as I said, because I walked out saying to myself, \"That\'s what I want to do.\" Sure the characters aren\'t deep and the dialogue isn\'t great, but who cares when the film is this entertaining? The actors are good in their parts, especially the always great Sam Neill, and the dinosaurs are incredibly life-like. The action is great, and the pacing (after a slow start) is relentless.

It was such an amazing achievement as a movie itself and the film is so wonderfully done that there\'s no doubt of why it has held up as long as it has and will remain the best dinosaur film ever created.\n\nThe dinosaurs in this film look more realistic than any other prehistoric film, or even most movies today that try to pass off crappy CGI has reality. The acting was spectacular, and aside from how wonderful the creatures look and how vicious and exciting they were like no other dinosaur film had had them before, the plot and characters were solid and incredibly entertaining where you didn\'t think they would be so amusing.\n\nI will have to say again that one really huge reason why most people loved this movie was because of the special effects, but here again, isn\'t that an accomplishment in itself? Having your audience enjoy the film because of how realistic and fresh you are able to make it feel and look? I have never seen another movie with better effects than this one, ever. I am sure none of these horrible effects dinosaur movies that have been coming out lately could ever live up to the greatness of Jurassic Park.\n\nI am always going to love Jurassic Park for it\'s witty, unbelievable maneuvers and incredible screenplay though, as well. It was so properly thought out and executed, where most might have been expecting it to be nothing but high levels of adrenaline rushes with brainless action, which there was pulsating action, it just certainly wasn\'t as mindless.

Richard Attenborough, a talented actor and a even more talented director also is good as John Hammond, while child star Joseph Mazello, who surprised me in Shadowlands is appealing as Tim. However, the real stars are the dinosaurs, especially the T-Rex, the mix of computer animation and models is inspiring.

Up to that time, nothing like it had ever been done on that scale. This is hard to remember when, since then, the Discovery Channel came up with the whole \"Walking with ...\" series of documentaries on dinosaurs, early man, and creatures before the dinosaur that use the same techniques that this film did, and thus people have become accustomed to this level of realism in animation both on the small and large screen.\n\nThus with the \"shock value\" of the animation removed, this movie doesn\'t seem quite as \"5-star\" as it did during its first run. The dialogue, in particular, seems a bit thin now. One aspect of the movie that still impresses me that doesn\'t get much mention is the outstanding use of sound and sound effects.

Ghostbusters, one of the most financially successful and over-hyped comedies of the eighties, underrated? Yes. Precicely because it was so over-hyped and made so much money, there has been a stigma attached to this film identifying it as a childish FX piece, when it is nothing of the sort. Most of the lines people remember(\"He slimed me,\" \"OK. So? She\'s a dog,\" \"When someone asks you if you\'re a god, you say YES!\") are not its funniest or wittiest lines, which often are missed on first or even second viewing. I laugh every time I observe a gag or a quip that I somehow missed the other 20 times I viewed a scene; \"Egon, this reminds me of the time you tried to drill a hole through your head, remember that?\" \"That would have worked if you hadn\'t stopped me\", or, to the driver of a van from a loony bin, \"Dropping off or picking up?\" Brilliant.\n\nNot only is Ghostbusters funny, it manages to include some truly scary scenes. And not just lose-your-popcorn moments like the fridge from Hell, but also scenes of quiet, thoughtful chill, like Egon\'s retelling of how the possessed apartment building came into being, or Winston recalling the Book of Revelation. Which other film has managed to combine the Marx Brothers with HP Lovecraft?\n\nThe special effects hold up well, besides some obvious studio sets and models, but what really creates this film\'s world is the stunning cinematography. Manhattan, perhaps the pinnacle of Gothic architectural evolution, is brilliantly utilised here to create a sense of menacing grandeur. After watching \"Ghostbusters\" I couldn\'t imagine the realm of the Old Gods opening into our world from anywhere else.

Nowadays I love it for the same reasons, but now that I\'m older I find myself appreciating the dialog which is some of the funniest committed to a film, the oddball humor, like Venkman\'s line about dogs and cats living together and the in jokes, like Slimer being the ghost of John Belushi and Venkman rubbing his hand at glee at the thought of the money to be made from the merchandising of the ghostbusters brand. Not only that, but some 80\'s hairstyles aside, the film as aged remarkably well. My cousin who is five years old has developed a love for the whole Ghostbusters thing, showing that this is truly worthy of being branded one of the most successful films ever made.\n\nUnlike many of today\'s blockbusters which are humorless and pompous thinking that they are serious films and forgetting about any sense of fun along with the complicated visual effects, Ghostbusters is funny and a fun paranormal movie. The set pieces are superb as we see the Ghostbusters going up against Slimer, Gozer and, undeniably the classic movie moment of the 80\'s, the Stay Puft Marshmallow Man. For a film made in 1984 the climax is very well done and looks exceedingly realistic, without any hint of clues as to the fact that it is a special effect. This is what going to the cinema should be all about. Fun with a capital F. All the actors get into it with great comedic aplomb. Bill Murray, one of the finest comedy actors to grace the screen, is superb as Peter Venkmen who gets the best lines in the film as well as the funniest moments. Just check out the \"there is no Dana, only Zool\" moment. Murray\'s priceless reaction to Dana Barrett\'s possession is one of the most side splitting moments I have ever seen. In fact, the casting is pretty much spot on. As well as Murray, we have co writers Dan Akyroyd and Harold Ramis sharing the spotlight as the fellow Ghostbusters, Sigourney Weaver making a wonderful damsel in distress, Rick Moranis is almost scene stealing as her nerd of a neighbor who becomes possessed himself, while Ernie Hudson and Annie Potts both put in wonderfully sardonic supporting roles who get their chances to shine.\n\nAdd to this one of the best theme tunes and a truly apocalyptic finale, it is no surprising that this was the biggest film of 1984. A summer blockbuster with humor, trills, spills and some of the best special effects money could buy at the time, this is truly a genuine classic and is one of the best Hollywood blockbusters ever made.'),(1318,79,'10/10','A timeless classic','cricketbat','27 December 2018','There aren\'t many movies better than Ghostbusters.

One of if not the greatest films ever! My favorite film of all time! \"Ghostbusters\" is the film that made me become a fan ever since I was young! It had an awesome cast, cool special effects, hilarious dialogue and a kick-ass soundtrack! The film that can be watched over and over again! I grew up watching Ghostbusters on TV and the animated TV series The Real Ghostbusters (1986 - 1991). Ghostbusters II (1989) actually introduced me in to Ghostbusters. I loved them so much that I even said to my mom, when I grown up I will be a Ghostbuster! It was my fantasy. Watching it yesterday and I still love it. I love this flick to death! I still can\'t believe it how the world changed and how in the 80\'s the world was better than today! I always have enjoyed the sequel much better than as a child, it was my first movie but now as an adult, I love and enjoy the original movie to death! It is the only movie I own on Blu-ray disc and I still love it.\n\nThis is an amazing movie! Funny, smart, well written and directed. It features an outstanding performance from Bill Murray, great showings by Harold Ramis, Rick Moranis and one of the last documented instances of Dan Aykroyd being funny on film (he was blown by a ghost!). In fact, the film gets a great performances from nearly everyone who appears in it- from Annie Potts, to the guy who played Lenny the Mayor, to the handsome cab driver who calls Rick Moranis an asshole. In addition, they had one of the best \"a-hole\" guys ever to appear on film, as the film\'s bad guy- I\'m talking of course of the grossly under-rated William Atherton- who played the EPA guy, \"Dickless\". Atherton, of course went on to play memorable a-holes in Real Genius and of course he was the annoying reporter in Die Hard (1988) but here in Ghostbusters, you really see a solid performance by maybe the best guy to play an a-hole in films in the 80\'s.\n\nNext Year the reboot is coming out as Paul Feig\'s Ghostsnuters, Ghostbitches or Ghostflufers./: Ghostbusters (2016) with women now as a Ghostbusters! Why rebooting this awesome supernatural spectacular comedy flick? I know the sequel failed and Bill Murray did not want anything to do with it. But that doesn\'t mean that they shouldn\'t have made Ghostbusters III in the 90\'s, they should have! Dan Aykroyd and Harold Ramis tried so hard to convince Bill Murray to do it for the third sequel and they couldn\'t convinced him. They are going to ruin the Original movie! I don\'t want to see Ghostbusters with a female leads. Come on? The girls are not the Ghostbusters, they are three man a scientists and a one civilian. The Ghostbusters are the only one Harold Ramis, Dan Aykroyd, Ernie Hudson and Bill Murray. They were always be the Ghostbusters that will be the case. No one else will be! No one else will replace them! This is like A Nightmare on Elm Street (1984) that come out the same year as the Ghostbusters did, they remake it and that remake failed!! It was awful boring! Why remaking or rebooting my classic horror comedy\'s that I Love?! Ghostbusters (1984) are unique, classic 80\'s masterpiece! These were the best times for movies ever!!! One of my favorite soundtracks and movie of all time!\n\nThey just don\'t make them like this anymore. This is comedic writing and performance at its peak... with quotes that everyone knows and enjoys. From \"This reminds me of the time you tried to drill a hole in your head\" to \"Symmetrical book stacking. Just like the Philadelphia mass turbulence of 1947\" to \"Many Shuvs and Zuuls knew what it was to be roasted in the depths of the Slor that day, I can tell you! \" this is a CLASSIC movie! Ghostbusters is a true classic comedy that stands the test of time. The film is funny, awesome and entertaining. It has a lot of laughs. I love the soundtrack Ghostbusters Written and Performed by Ray Parker Jr. I think he did made a great soundtrack in the 80\'s. If there\'s something strange in your neighborhood, who you gonna call? GHOSTBUSTERS!!!! A film that can be watched with the various youngest to the very oldest of the family. Wonderful collection of characters. A film that is treasured by just about everyone that watches it. I miss movies from the 80\'s and this film felt so realistic.

Despite some classic moments of dry humour from Bill Murray, the impressive sight of a Godzilla-size Mr. Stay Puft trashing New York, and the even more impressive sight of Sigourney Weaver\'s lovely, long legs, the film just isn\'t as great as my memory had led me to believe: it\'s rather cheap looking at times, with shonky props, unconvincing sound-stage sets, and crowd-scenes of, oh, at least 50 people; the effects that once dazzled now look embarrassingly bad, with iffy stop motion animation, crap matte work, random flashy lights, and Richard Edlund\'s Oscar nominated \'ink in water\' clouds looking just like... well, just like ink in water; and rather than being a roller-coaster ride of laughs and scares, the film is actually pretty dull at times. Sorry kids, but I was so sure that this film rocked; instead, it\'s just another passable piece of 80s nostalgia for the middle-aged.\n\nOh well, at least the theme song is still a corker; all together now.... Who ya gonna call?'),(1323,79,'9/10','One of the funniest films of all time. Who ya gonna call? GHOSTBUSTERS!','MovieAddict2016','20 December 2003','I have a small posse of favorite comedians. Somewhere towards the top of that list, along with Steve Martin, is Bill Murray. He\'s been around since the early 80s, getting his start on NBC\'s \"Saturday Night Live\" after Chevy Chase left for his own career in Hollywood. Murray worked live for a few years before -- like those prior to him him -- gradually making his way into the film world.\n\nI like all of the comedians in \"Ghostbusters,\" come to think of it. Dan Aykroyd is another great subtle comedian, with a great knack for writing as well as acting. It was Aykroyd, after all, who is primarily responsible for \"The Blues Brothers.\" And Harold Ramis, who later became a director, with an impressive resume of such films as \"Vacation,\" \"Groundhog Day,\" and \"Analyze This.\"\n\nThen there\'s also Rick Moranis, a meek nerd character who is very underrated and very funny, a sort of Woody Allen Lite. He was Dark Helmet in \"Spaceballs,\" Barney Coopersmith in \"My Blue Heaven,\" and that wacky inventor in \"Honey I Shrunk the Kids.\"\n\nYes, one could say that \"Ghostbusters\" is built on a firm base, scripted by Aykroyd, Ramis and Moranis (who is uncredited) and directed by Ivan Reitman (\"Kindergarten Cop\"). It\'s a clever little story with a simple premise and lots of laughs -- a band of failing friends unite to make a hoax ghost-busting company, but soon real ghosts do show up and they\'re in over their heads.\n\nIt starts in New York City. Peter Venkman (Murray), Raymond Stanz (Aykroyd), and Egon Spengler (Ramis) are three Columbia University scientists laid off after their grant expires with no results from the trio in return. Down to nothing, they cook up the brilliant (or crazy) idea to create a \"ghost-busting\" company.\n\nBut they immediately realize that it won\'t be as easy as it seems to get a little extra cash, because Dana Barrett (Sigourney Weaver) comes to the men looking for help. Her apartment is infested with strange happenings, and her next-door neighbor, Louis Tully (Rick Moranis), is having problems of his own.\n\nThey pretend to solve the situation and the men suddenly become a citywide phenomenon, attracting media attention and constant customers at their front door. They become so popular, in fact, that they are joined by Winston Zeddmore (Ernie Hudson), another down-on-his-luck city guy looking for a good-paying job.\n\nHowever, Walter Peck, EPA (William Atherton) doesn\'t believe that the Ghostbusters are really ridding any ghosts at all, so he has them thrown in jail. But an ethreal baddie named Gozer (Slavitza Jovan) soon appears in Dana\'s apartment complex, and weird happenings occur, forcing Peck to free the Ghostbusters once and for all so that they can bust the ghost and send it back to where it came from.\n\nSounds corny, huh? It\'s meant to be. Everything about this movie is campy and goofy, and that is exactly what Ramis, Aykroyd and Moranis wanted when they collaborated. And it is very funny.\n\nI don\'t know, there\'s something in me that loves \"Saturday Night Live\" humor. Sure, the show has its dry spots, but I love it. Many people I know don\'t find it all that funny, and not as consistent as something such as \"The Simpsons,\" but I love to watch it, I love the humor, and I love the actors.\n\nPart of that love, I suppose, is what makes me enjoy \"Ghostbusters\" (1984) so much. However, believe it or not, \"Ghostbusters\" is not quite as laugh-out-loud funny as you might expect. It is very funny, but it isn\'t always a howler. It\'s more of an intelligent comedy, which is odd, since it is made by a band of guys from \"Saturday Night Live\" and such backgrounds.\n\nMurray steals every scene he is in. This, along with `Groundhog Day,\' is the perfect vehicle for his comedic talents, ranging from the constant wise cracks to the constant dry ironic humor that I love so much. They key to his humor is not that he comes up with it, but the way he does it. Any comedian can use the blank glares, but the way he expressionlessly glares at fellow actors is a joke in itself. When Stanz admits that his one fear has always been the Stay Puff\'d man, check out Murray\'s face. This is classic stuff.\n\nAs much a scene-stealer as Murray may be, he is nearly upstaged by Aykroyd and Ramis, who both provide a sort of counter-balance of lunatics and reason to Murray\'s flippant characteristics. The scene that everyone remembers it the finale involving the giant marshmallow Stay Puff\'d Man, and whenever I think of Aykroyd\'s performance in this film, I think of that scene.\n\n\"Ghostbusters\" is a very famous comedy, and for good reason. It\'s light, good-hearted, funny, and actually pretty intelligent, built upon a firm cast and script, which -- considering the majority of the actors\' and writers\' backgrounds of \"Saturday Night Live\" -- is almost as surprising as the film itself.\n\n5/5 stars.'),(1324,79,'7/10','Who you gonna call?','talexander12599','1 August 2015','Ghostbusters is a movie from 1984 starring Bill Murray (Groundhog Day, Lost in Translation, Moonrise Kingdom), Dan Aykroyd (The Blues Brothers, Ghostbusters Franchise, Trading Places), Harold Ramis (Groundhog Day, Analyze This, Ghostbusters Franchise) and Sigourney Weaver (Alien Franchise Avatar). It was written Dan Aykroyd, Harold Ramis and Rick Moranis (Honey I Shrunk the Kids, Spaceballs, Strange Brew) and is directed by Ivan Reitman (Ghostbusters Franchise, Up in the Air, No Strings Attached).\n\nGhostbusters follows three scientists: Peter (Bill Murray), Ray (Dan Aykroyd) and Egon (Harold Ramis) as they start their own ghost catching business and their biggest job yet is in a musician named Dana\'s (Sigourney Weaver) own refrigerator.\n\nThis hilarious movie is carried by is fun characters brought to life by Bill Murray, Dan Aykroyd, and Harold Ramis. They are each very different and very funny in their own ways. Murray plays a classic, sarcastic Bill Murray character, Aykroyd plays a nervous quiet man who is really excited to be living out his dream and Ramis plays a very smart, nerdy, and odd man. They ad-lib most of their lines which makes this all even better.\n\nI actually think the success of Ghostbusters led to all of this ghost hunter reality show crap we see on TV today. This was the first movie to really have the idea of ghost hunting itself which means it is very original and started a ghost craze and a (not so good) sequel.\n\nMost of the effects in this movie do look quite dated while films like Blade Runner (which came out two years earlier) do not.

I was amazed to find out on the GHOSTBUSTERS 15th Anniversary DVD that Murray had little to do with the dialogue his classicly blase, fiercely cynical \'Dr. Venkman\' cuts loose throughout this good comedy. Credit Dan Aykroyd and Harold Ramis with \"getting into Bill\'s mind\" as Ramis puts it and presenting Murray with a gag-a-second character. Murray also lends his own comic genius through his delivery and facial gestures (especially with his classic cross-eyed, curled-lip look). Together with a fun premise and above average special effects, GHOSTBUSTERS will never be a relic of the 80\'s and should always be a refreshingly humorous spook show.\n\nMurray rules the screen, mauling his geeky para-psychologist partners and hitting on a young blonde while conducting shock therapy experiments on her. Aykroyd uses his standard machine gun delivery of obscure (or should I say made up) facts and anecdotes and Ramis is just enough for the ultra-dork \'Egon\'. The funniest element in GHOSTBUSTERS happens to be Rick Moranis in a splendid role as a small-time accountant who has parties for clients only and becomes mixed up in some extremely supernatural events. Along with Sigourney Weaver, Moranis has the most difficult physical tasks to topple.\n\nThis was a picture I loved when I was a kid. I must have went some 12 to 15 years before I saw it again and I was alarmingly impressed. It has endured. The special effects are not only good, but they are comedic and add even more laughs throughout the \'Busters turbulent jobs. The DVD version has tons of goodies included and is an essential addition to any Saturday Night Live fan\'s movie library. SNL is the very essence and reason for GHOSTBUSTERS, where Murray and Aykroyd starred. Director Ivan Reitman created his meal ticket here and can pretty much do any comedy he wants now.\n\nIt is a shame John Belushi was not around to play one of the \'Busters, for he was originally cast. The movie is already well-paced and engaging so just imagine how frenzied the pace would have been with Belushi. Regardless, GHOSTBUSTERS is one for the kids, teens, and adults alike.

The main storyline originates from the Mahabharata so the creators really needed to push the boundaries on the execution, which I can say that they did but were they able to pull it off extraordinarily or were there shortcomings? Read on to find out.\n\nI have attempted to break down my thoughts of each major field without giving any spoilers or too much negative connotations.\n\nDialogues:\n\nNot much to say about these, they are what you would expect from a sci-fi flick (some hi-fi English vocabulary paired with the modern Hindi), and the archaic style Hindi (Sanksritised) that is generally seen in the adaptations of Hindu epics.\n\nCharacters:\n\nI am sorry to say but the chemistry between is Bhairava & Bujji was almost non-existent. They did talk about stuff other than bounties and work but the final result was too many puns and attempts to make the audience laugh which left nothing to be established between them.\n\nThe portrayal of Prabhas\' character got a bit tiresome at the start. The interactions between Bhairava and anyone were very, very boring. Apart from that, he wasn\'t exactly a formidable force either, and so wasn\'t Ashwatthama.\n\nI genuinely feel that the creator didn\'t give any character the power that they deserved. For instance, Ashwatthama\'s powers are bound to the plot, they only work in last resorts. Bhairava does godlike damage as a human. \"Other enemies\" are literally Stormtroopers and some times really dumb.\n\nThen, the character of Deepika Padukone. It was appropriately executed according to her and the plot, so no complaints there.\n\nThe remaining characters are nothing to write home about, nothing of that gravity as of the main 3 characters.\n\nStory & Execution:\n\nThe start of the first half was stretched too much, with a lot of that stretched time going to Bhairava (intro & fillers). Then again, his interactions with others were extremely dull.\n\nThere were many continuity errors, like skipping somewhat essential bridging scenes and abruptly changing the theme of the scene altogether.\n\nApart from that, the story (pertaining to the Mahabharata) was told superbly. The flashbacks of Ashwatthama were really good (so was his character). You could really feel the high stakes throughout the movie.\n\nSo in essence, the plot was well planned out, but the execution on the character part fell a tad bit short.\n\nVFX:\n\nI went in with high hopes and I came out both surprised and disappointed. At some parts, the VFX was outstanding, but in some places, it was the exact opposite (like the de-aged AB looking like he came straight out of \"Motu Patlu\").\n\nThe bad VFX was best visible during fighting sequences and JUMPS (with some scattered across the film). I cannot stress this enough when I say that the jumps (and the flying) were very inorganic, it was so cable-y, everyone was hovering around. The film was really jump and flight heavy, and given the fact that there are humans of godly stature and a \'Chiranjeevi\' involved (enemies being thrown around and protagonists jumping 20 feet), this shouldn\'t come as a surprise.\n\nCinematography:\n\nPretty standard, nothing too extravagant. Overall, a solid setup.\n\nMusic:\n\nAn absolute treat to the ears. I loved Ashwatthama\'s theme (right from the announcement). The Bhairava theme was the only thing that felt out of place (but that just might be me). Also, maybe I am nitpicking too much now, but the mixing and the abrupt change in tones across scenes affected the experience a bit. Nevertheless, the music complimented the scenes perfectly.\n\nInfluences:\n\nAs you know, this movie is inspired by the Mahabharata. I would say that the references to the epic and the sci-fi present day story were well balanced. It all made sense and after all, the essence is that of the Mahabharata\'s depiction.\n\nIn conclusion, the plot was extremely good, story was told really well. It however, lacked in the department of VFX and a special department named \"Bhairava\". So, the execution was a bit of a miss. However, even with its downsides, the intriguing story and some goosebumps moments (especially towards the end) make this a worthwhile watch!'),(1341,80,'8/10','Another Pan Indian Epic!!!','shyamkrishsai','27 June 2024','Kalki28989AD amply suffices my expectations in terms of the story and the visuals.

He has a roaring screen presence and excels. #DeepikaPadukone gets a meaty part and is the soul of the film. She delivers a fabulous performance, lending the right emotions. #Prabhas does well in his part though his character warranted a better arc. I feel, the maker has saved the best of #Prabhas for the sequel. He gets his share of elevation moments and emerges a winner in there. His act in the climax is sure to be greeted with seeti\'s and taali\'s. #KamalHaasan is terrific in his cameo and spikes excitement for the next installment. #SawataChatterjee is solid as the villain.\n\nSome of the cameos are exciting and come across as a pleasant surprise in the narrative.\n\nOverall, #Kalki2898AD is an ambitious film and director #NagAshwin deserves full marks for sticking to his conviction. While 30 minutes of trimming (especially first half) would elevate the experience, the film has enough in the second half to warrant a theatrical watch and keep the audience interested for the sequel.'),(1344,80,'10/10','Mythology meets science fiction','anilsingaraya','27 June 2024','Nag Ashwin has created a nice fusion of mythology and the science fiction world.

The fight sequences and the use of mad Max type of world does look like an imitation, but it has a distinct indian attribute of heroism and larger than life action heroics of the two main protagonists of the movie that Hollywood probably can\'t ever match. The casting of Amitabh Bachchan as Ashwatthama is excellent. Prabhas looks stunning as the hero and no one else from Indian cinema can pull off a role like he can.

The film could have been a lot better instead of this pseudo Lone Survivor meets Rambo the Interpreter story that is almost laughable at some parts.\n\nIt\'s highly unrealistic and the typical good vs bad guys attempting to portray a country being invaded by foreigners to liberate them after 9/11 - is a rather pathetic misunderstanding by Ritchie of the facts for the invasion. But there are some great action sequences and it is a unique perspective for a film maker to focus on the risk some interpreters took in helping the invading forces. And ends ironically with the Taliban and Afghans recapturing their country one month later - so the entire escapade feels rather like a bleak of an ending and no idea why Ritchie decided to make this film rather than a documentary about the subject.\n\nIf you like Top Gun or Lone Survivor this film is a nice attempt of glamorizing the US military coming to save the day from the bad guys.

My one and only negative comment was the acting by one of the lead actors. Jake was way too passive and nonchalant during the majority of the movie. They needed someone more assertive to play the role. He just seemed like he was high and lost the entire movie. He was supposed to be acting as the role of an 18Z MOS for the Army or equivalent for a Navy spec ops team. Then the fact that they double-used words for names; like chow chow? Is it because the lead actor was strung out? Aside from his acting, this was an amazing film. I would highly recommend watching this movie.

This film honours them and their sacrifices more than the government ever has or will. And I respect that! Not so much the character development here, as the flaws were quite notable.\n\nOther segments were thankfully well handled; there was a sufficient amount of blood, gunfights, explosions, and all the usual stuff, along with Guy Ritchie\'s signature style of suspense and, most importantly, two standout performances.

Neel Sethi plays the main character, Mowgli in the movie. He is the only human being on screen and as his first ever role, this kid actor is truly magnificent. He is as good as any kid actor has ever been, even favorably compared to Haley Joel Osment in The Sixth Sense. The computer generated imagery is brilliant all throughout, definitely some of the best ever and the 3D is just mind blowing. In every single scene I kept getting surprised and thrilled at just how amazing the CGI and 3D were. I think the main reason as to why this movie worked it\'s because it also has a very good story line that\'s mixed in with the amazing visuals. Also, the voice actors are all perfectly cast. Especially Idris Elba as Shere Khan, who is truly haunting in every scene he\'s in. That was one well made and scary villain that Mowgli had to face. Jon Favreau did a fantastic work with this movie, cause really this story has been told many times before, and yet this movie feels fresh and interesting nonetheless.

The entire jungle looks absolutely real, yet it\'s not, and that\'s the great thing about it.\n\nThe characters themselves were pretty cool. I didn\'t care for Mowgli in the original movie, but this movie got me liking him. He\'s brave, not as bratty, and he\'s pretty inventive. Bagheera is as stern and careful as ever except that he\'s also got the action his book counterpart had had. And I like Baloo\'s character here, having a bit more of a self-serving trait his older counterparts never had but eventually becoming a nice guy. And that\'s the main characters. The wolves got more screen time, Kaa got a lot more dangerous (though she doesn\'t have as much screen time, which is my only complaint in this movie), King Louie is more sinister and less comical, and Shere Khan is a flat-out beast.\n\nI\'m also glad that they brought back three songs I enjoyed as a kid. I really liked Bare Necessities, and I\'ve also started singing this version of I Wanna Be Like You. Trust In Me made me feel like Kaa was in a spy movie.\n\nSo on a scale from one to ten, I\'d give it a perfect score: 10/10. It\'s an epic movie, and I highly recommend seeing this movie.'),(1378,82,'9/10','Expectations initially were mixed, expectations were exceeded','TheLittleSongbird','28 April 2016','The 1967 animated film to me is still one of Disney\'s best of the \"classic era\". This is not just nostalgia talking, quite a few childhood favourites have not held up, but \'The Jungle Book\' is an example of one that has.\n\nExpectations were mixed for seeing this film. The trailer looked great, the voice cast is filled with enormous talent and the featurette was fascinating. It was just that, relating it to the other Disney live action adaptations, whether it was going to be one example of a re-boot that looked stunning, was well-written and performed, respected its original source material(s) and added its fresh spin, like \'Cinderella, or a well-made film with enough other decent elements to make it watchable but also one lacking in soul and charm, like \'Alice in Wonderland\'.\n\nFortunately, \'The Jungle Book\' is an even stronger example of the former, and is one of Jon Favreau\'s best films along with \'Iron Man\'. Fans of the animation will love recognising the familiar characters and scenes and it was also really nice to see more of Rudyard Kipling\'s writing and story telling here, the ending being closer to that of the animated film. \'The Jungle Book\' is wonderful on its own merits too, just like the Disney animated film was, which was a poor adaptation of the book but worked so well as a film on its own that it didn\'t matter.\n\nCriticisms for the film are very few. The first criticism is that Kaa\'s scene and screen-time is far too short, a great character like Kaa deserves far more than a mere five minutes or so. And it is a shame because it is a very suspenseful and hypnotic scene with some of the film\'s most striking visuals, and the deceptively maternal story teller approach was beautifully written and delivered. Regrettably, the other criticism was \"I Wanna Be Like You\". While one of the highlights of the animated film, and one of Disney\'s most iconic moments, because the scene is darker and King Louie more intimidating (in size and manner), also because it comes out of nowhere, the light-hearted fun of the song that worked so brilliantly before just doesn\'t fit here (if Christopher Walken really did desperately want to sing the song, it didn\'t show in his singing because he sounded uninterested and hesitant).\n\nOn the other hand, the film looks amazing. The rich, expansive cinematography is some of the best of the year so far and the scenery and settings are so vividly detailed and colourful, that reading that it was shot entirely in a warehouse was a shock. The rendering of the animals are staggeringly realistic, especially Shere Khan, Bagheera and the monkeys. Favreau directs with a keen eye for detail and spectacle, yet doesn\'t forget the drama, cast or the storytelling once. John Debney\'s music score is full of energy, atmosphere, warm orchestration and vibrant emotion, its referencing of familiar themes feeling nostalgic and affectionate rather than cheap. As for the songs in the film, although \"I Wanna Be Like You\" was a disappointment \"Bear Necessities\" fitted right in and was as good-natured and easy-going as one can hope and \"Trust in Me\" is worth listening to if you stay for the closing credits, Scarlett Johansson with her low-register, smoky yet sensual tone does a surprisingly good job with the song.\n\n\'The Jungle Book\'s\' script is very funny (Baloo getting the funniest lines, and some of them were hilarious) without being childish or simplistic while also easy to understand and thought-provoking, there is a good amount of depth too without being too dark or sugary sweet. The story moves quickly and is constantly enthralling, one thing it does better than the animated version is expanding on motivations and making characters more interesting (as great a villain as Shere Khan is in the animated film, his motivation to me seemed clearer here). The climax is dramatically satisfying and darkly tense.\n\nA great job is done with the characters also. They\'re not complex, but they are likable and interesting, are very true in personality to their animated counterparts and all serve a point in the storytelling, some like Shere Khan and the wolves expanded upon. It was easy to identify with Mowgli, Baloo is a breath of fresh air and to me a great villain is one that one can totally see why the villain is hated or feared but one can also understand their point of view, which is the case with Shere Khan (this is true of the animated film too, but as Shere Khan has more of a back story here it came through stronger to me). The cast were a talented one to begin with and their talents absolutely shine through. Newcomer Neel Sethi does very credibly as Mowgli, it is incredibly hard to react against nothing and apart from a few naturally stiff moments to begin with he handles all the different emotional elements very well. The superbly chosen vocal cast are even better.\n\nBill Murray was born for Baloo (sounding far more engaged than as Garfield), his relaxed but witty voice-work matching the character\'s easy-going, good-natured personality. Idris Elba effectively puts dread into one\'s heart as Shere Khan, he\'s silky, regal, charismatic and genuinely menacing, though George Sanders brought over the suavity and oiliness more. Ben Kingsley is a stern yet sympathetic Bagheera, and Christopher Walken, in a characterisation that is like a mix of mobster boss, Colonel Kurtz and Walken\'s own mannerisms, makes King Louie intimidating but also entertaining. Scarlett Johansson\'s voice work for Kaa is eerily sensual, Giancarlo Esposito is a dignified Akeela and Lupita Nyong\'o\'s Raksha is movingly compassionate.\n\nIn conclusion, a truly great film. Works very well as a live-action re-boot and works even more as a film in general. An epic visually stunning adventure, told with fun, heart and depth. 9/10 Bethany Cox'),(1379,82,'6/10','Pales in comparison to the 1967 animated one...','dongray-30518','7 February 2021','1st this is certainly not the first remake of the 1942 movie which was a bit of a different story and plot. While the 1942 movie was the original, it\'s usually the 1967 animated version from Disney that is best known. The 1967 one\'s plot has been done over and over especially in the 90s where several little kids TV versions and a badly chided movie were common. The first one was a great movie in it\'s 1940s time. Most people then thought it was great to be able to see all the animals. But now most people, jaded by better TV and movie productions no longer have interest in the really poor use of fake, stuffed animals used in the 1942 one.\n\nThis 2016 version was closest in plot to the 1967 animated musical which is the most popular version. This one is not nearly as musically inclined like the 1967 one was. The animal songs in the 1967 one were exceptionally great. Frankly, I hope to never have to hear Bill Murray sing again as he did in this version. It was absolutely the most awful singing of \"Bare Necessities\". It was just absolutely out of tune and no sense timing. Murray sang it like he was drunk or stoned. Of course he thought he was being cute and funny. But frankly he ruined his song. The well produced bluesy, jazzy numbers of the 1967 songs were mostly mutilated in this movie. The one pleasant exception was Christopher Walken\'s version of the \"I wanna be like you song\". He added ape sounds to just the right places in the song so you knew it was the ape\'s song. But still pales next to the 1967 singing.\n\nThe place the movie did excel was in the CGI creatures. The talking CGI animals were a great way to make the imagination grasp the crazy theme that is Jungle Book. That was a good deal better than the 1967 animations of the boy and animals jumping, hopping and climbing in very unrealistic animated ways. The plot was mostly the same as the 1967 one with only a few differences, mostly in it\'s ending.\n\nThere\'s not a lot of sense in fully discussing the plot of a title that has been done over and over again. Not much to give away here. Almost everyone has seen some similar version of the Jungle Book. Just read the movie descriptions and you\'ll get what you need to know. One thing about this version is some of the big name actors that signed on to do voices. Just look at IMDBs cast list and you\'re bound to see some very famous actors and comedians.\n\nThe problem with this movie isn\'t that it\'s a bad movie. It\'s not. But frankly I found myself wanting to go back and watch the much better 1967 animated musical version and did. If you are going to do a remake, you need to improve on the original as it will be compared with the other versions.

The attempt to bring the animals to life with realistic visuals, while technically impressive, leaves some emotional depth lacking, and the music, despite its memorable tunes from the animated classic, doesn\'t quite hit the same notes. Consequently, The Jungle Book receives a 6/10 rating from me, as it falls short of recapturing the magic of its source material and struggles to leave a lasting impression.\n2 out of 2 found this helpful.

It was also not a good feeling to see cuts, scrapes and scars on Mowgli as the movie progressed. This is realistic for the amount of action, but it made me uncomfortable seeing this in an almost naked kid getting abused and almost killed by half the jungle.\n\nThe two times the movie broke out into song, also didn\'t really fit with this version either. If it had 5 or ten songs, you wouldn\'t notice, but those two moments really stood out and dumbed the movie down to me.\n\nAll the voices were pretty good, except Christopher Walken who seem woefully miscast and as King Louie and Bill Murray as/and the too cartoony Baloo character I also didn\'t really care for either.\n\nIt was also odd/unsettling that all the main characters were intelligent, but other animals seemed retarded (hedgehog?) or just normal animals? The monkeys and elephants in particular didn\'t talk, and these are two of the smartest most human-like in real life so this was really weird.\n\nOn the other hand, Idris Elba was gold as Sheer Khan and Scarlett Johansson\'s Kaa is perfect, like her voice performance in \'Her\' she was wonderful as the hypnotic snake villain.\n\nHad me in tears at times, all in all good, honest Disney fun in the spirit of the best of them like \'Lion King\', Aladdin or Toy Story.'),(1384,82,'9/10','Does justice to the animated classic.','Anurag-Shetty','8 April 2016','The Jungle Book is a live-action adaptation of Disney\'s famous animated film, The Jungle Book(1967). It is also based on Rudyard Kipling\'s novel of the same name. Mowgli(Neel Sethi) has lived in the jungle, for as long as he can remember. In the jungle, he is raised by a pack of wolves, led by Akela(Giancarlo Esposito). A wolf named Raksha(Lupita Nyong\'o), is the only mother he has ever known. He has an ally & a friend, in a panther named Bagheera(Ben Kingsley). When the treacherous tiger Shere Khan(Idris Elba), opposes to Mowgli staying in the jungle, Bagheera has to return the man-cub to the man village. While on their journey, Mowgli & Bagheera receive help from a grizzly bear, named Baloo(Bill Murray). Now, it is up to Bagheera & Baloo to take Mowgli to the man village, safe & sound.\n\nThe Jungle Book is a mind blowing film. It is the most gorgeous movie, I have ever seen. What\'s extremely fascinating is that, the whole environment in the film is CGI. The animals are also CGI & yet, they look extremely lifelike. The forest the movie is set in, looks breathtaking. Director Jon Favreau & the rest of the crew, have maintained the soul of the 1967 animated movie of the same name. Kudos to the visual effects team, for making a live-action adaptation of a movie like The Jungle Book. Don\'t worry. This film is not a carbon copy of the Disney animated original. Favreau adds many new elements to the film, that will keep you guessing right till the end. The set pieces of the movie, are its highlight. The 3D provides immersion & there are quite a few scenes, that will make you duck in your seats. The casting is flawless. Newcomer Neel Sethi is outstanding as Mowgli. Sethi doesn\'t just play Mowgli, he embodies the character. Bill Murray is hilarious & adorable as Baloo. Murray & Sethi\'s rendition of The Bare Necessities, is as good as the 1967 version of the same song. Ben Kingsley is awesome as Bagheera. Idris Elba is spectacular as Shere Khan. Elba\'s voice-over of the predatory antagonist, is menacing & flawless. Lupita Nyong\'o is amazing as Raksha. Nyong\'o gives an emotional & layered performance, as the voice of Mowgli\'s adoptive mother. Scarlett Johansson is excellent as Kaa. I liked Johansson\'s version of Kaa, much better than the \'67 incarnation of the sneaky snake. Giancarlo Esposito is great as Akela. Christopher Walken is superb as King Louie. The Jungle Book is a must watch on the big screen, with your entire family. Go, relive this timeless tale.'),(1385,82,'9/10','Forget about your worries and your strife...','kevin_newdirections','9 April 2016','To those who still hold any degree of skepticism for Jon Favreau\'s The Jungle Book—Disney\'s live-action adaptation of the Rudyard Kiplingclassic—I say just sing along to \"Forget about your worries and your strife\" That\'s a guaranteed earworm from this really good film. Complete with splendid sound design and flabbergasting CGI wizardry, director Favreau, with cinematographer Bill Pope, deftly crafts this spectacle not only to dazzle viewers but also to enhance its dramatic agenda.\n\nWith an excellent voice cast, The Jungle Book presents a colorful array of memorable characters. Idris Elba as Shere Kahn is chillingly formidable with his guttural threats. Ben Kingsley brings nobility and wisdom in the sleek jungle cat Bagheera. In her short sequence as the python Kaa, Scarlett Johansson delivers the film\'s backstory with a magnetic voice. Giancarlo Eposito\'s Akela and Lupita Nyong\'o\'s Raksha supply the fierce patriarch and protective maternal vibes needed by their characters. Christopher Walken as the mafia-king orangutan waiting for extinction is an oddly delightful sight, especially when he starts to sing. Bill Murray as the manipulative sloth bear Baloo is a crowd favorite as he blurs the line between being annoying and adorable. Even the lesser animals (porcupine, pygmy hog, squirrel, etc.) manage to steal the show as sources of comic relief.\n\nIn his first feature appearance, Neel Sethi as young Mowgli is tasked with selling the wonder and portraying the humanity of this tale. Considering that he is basically working within the confines of his imagination and a green screen room for the entire film, he manages to make everything believable: the beauty and danger of the jungle, his kinetic and charismatic character, and his deep connection with the animals. Of course, this is owed in large part to Jon Favreau\'s direction\'s too. A magical scene in the film (and my favorite!): an infant Mowgli and Bagheera\'s innocently touches Bagheera\'s face. It\'s a sweet moment, a reminder that the there\'s a seed of humanity in each of us.\n\nAlthough the film comes a bit dark, fans are not robbed of iconic songs such as \"The Bare Necessities\", \"I Wanna Be Like You,\" and a jovial musical scoring for the film (thanks to John Debney). Old as it may, the story of The Jungle Book remains an affecting contemplation on the virtues of family, self-growth, and man\'s progress at the expense of nature. The Jungle Book successfully opens a new chapter in cinema\'s visual storytelling prowess. It deserves to be seen, and unequivocally needs to be experienced in 3D or better, an IMAX theater. It is immersive, it is enchanting, and it is wonderful.\n\nFull review here: http://www.filmpolicereviews.com/reviews/the-jungle-book'),(1386,82,'6/10','Had high hopes for this one','stefanor99','17 April 2016','Just got back from taking my 3 year old to this, she absolutely loved it, mesmerised by the scenery and the talking animals which are incredibility photo realistic.

It doesn\'t quite work as well as it should. They took King Louie and made him into an intimidating monster which is a shame because his character in the cartoon was one of the best.\n\nHats off to Jon Faverau for giving it a shot and not completely messing it up which would have been easy to do; maybe the Disney committee got in the way and skewed it the wrong way slightly.'),(1387,82,'8/10','A journey to find oneself as the heart of the tale is ageless, and the surreal visual as well as vibrant music make this Jungle Book a completely riveting experience. .','quincytheodore','8 April 2016','Nostalgia is a powerful thing, the original Jungle Books has been adored by many, be it the animation or movie interpretations. The new rendition takes the expectation and rises beyond with emotionally engaging and larger-than-life characters, which is no small feat considering it relies on sole child actor Neel Sethi while the rest of the veteran cast lend their voices for the animal kingdom.\n\nStory follows Mowgli (Neel Sethi) on his two feet as he ventures around the thick jungle. He meets with near mythical allies and foes alike, while learning and accepting his unique nature. A lot rest on his small shoulders, and as Mowgli he performs remarkably well. He presents an innocent vibe even though the harsh jungle is demanding and sometimes merciless.\n\nVisual is utterly impressive, these beasts look and move very naturally. There has been talking animals before, but the sway of their furs, the slight gestures different to each species and how the environment reacts to their motions are nothing less than exceptional. These subtle details give lives to characters from two dimensional then make them dreamlike lively.\n\nThe famous voices another layer of their personalities, from the protective Ben Kingsley as Bagheera, merry Bill Murray as Baloo to Idris Elba as fierce Shere Khan. Its sound effects and songs are symphony of the wild, it hits just the right tune with nostalgic effect and engaging soundtracks.\n\nThe new tale of one child and his fauna companions is brilliantly told by exhilarating graphic and harmonic concerto.'),(1388,82,'7/10','Think twice- you might not think that it will be more engaging than BvS!','asb_deutsch','7 April 2016','It\'s not a bad movie and it\'s certainly watchable, but it\'s not very good either. If you love the original one you\'ll probably like this one too. It might be the best The Jungle Book out there, though, whatever that counts for. Usually Disney movies leave me feeling really good about myself and the world, this one left me with nothing. Btw, that awesome Bare Necessities music from the trailers isn\'t used in the movie until the very end for one small sequence. Major letdown. Also, the trailers showed every major frame in the movie. The theater was full of kids, though, and they laughed all the time, so they probably liked it a whole lot. \n\nVerdict: It was underwhelming and disappointing. Lame story, shallow characters. Cool end credits. Fun songs, cute digital animals. 6/10 for cool visuals and King Louie.\n\nFinal Verdict: It is just a one-time watch!

The stories are fables and use animals in an anthropomorphic manner to give moral lessons. Jon Favreau knows the divine quality of the works and he gives us that and more and more and more.....\n\nI thought Disney\'s Zootopia has reached an epoch in CGI, but The Jungle Book is definitely the crowned jewel. I was awestruck by the level of visual details of each animal that occupies the screen. The facial expressions mirroring its running gamut of emotions, the physical movements of each animal, the pitch-perfect voicing - who wouldn\'t believe they possess a human soul?\n\nFilms using a predominance of CGI go stale very fast if the story cannot keep up. The seams will start to show and the minutes will turn to hours. Looking at all the frames of The Jungle Book, other than Neel Sethi as Mowgli, everything is CGI-ed to the Ying Yang. But the sense of story is so compelling, I was totally immersed in the world. Yes, animals can talk! I am a believer! Favreau marries the narrative and the visuals so well, I couldn\'t see one without the other. It is the perfect marriage - each element serving the other in a symbiotic relationship. The sound design is also an aural extravaganza - just listen to the scene where the anaconda, voiced by Scarlett Johansson, engages and hypnotises Mowgli. The surround sound design is jaw-dropping oh la la. In fact, I think the entire movie is a demo disc for home theatres!\n\nThis is one of the most satisfying movies I have seen this year. There is something here for everyone, from the kids to the adults. As much as I was totally captivated by the movie, I did make one snide remark (actually two, but I will keep the second one to myself). At a languid scene of Mowgli floating down the river with Baloo the bear, voiced by the incomparable Bill Murray, thick undergrowth starts to rustle and ominous music starts to reverberate. Mowgli and Baloo stare fearfully at the moving bushes, getting ready for impending danger as best as they can. I turned to the missus and whispered, \"I think Leonardo DiCaprio is going to pop out.\" She laughed.'),(1390,82,'9/10','Exceeds expectations!!','roniksharma','8 April 2016','More than children, parents are going to enjoy this movie as this movie defines more excellence than the original book itself! Well, you might already know the premise of this film but anyway.. here it goes..\n\nRaised by a family of wolves since birth, Mowgli must leave the only home he\'s ever known when the fearsome tiger Shere Khan unleashes his mighty roar. Guided by a no-nonsense panther and a free-spirited bear, the young boy meets an array of jungle animals, including a slithery python and a smooth-talking ape. Along the way, Mowgli learns valuable life lessons as his epic journey of self-discovery leads to fun and adventure.\n\nThe performances are amazing. Neel Sethi can be referred as \"a small bomb, but a loud blast\". His performance as Mowgli was terrific. Bill Murray enacts the same lazy old bear we know, and exceeds in fulfilling expectations. Ben Kingsley satisfies on delivering Bagheera. Scarlett Johannson does not provide a performance as great as the others but is just.... \"good\".\n\nLast but not the least is the greatest performance provided from the whole cast, Idris Elba as Shere Khan!! He outperforms everyone with a cunning and terrifying voice, which is justified for the villain\'s character\n\nTo be honest, I thought this movie was going to be another big bomb after Batman V Superman.

Every aspect of the movie delivers to the audience and makes an impressive overall package. Jean Reno plays a character named Léon who has learned to repress his emotions in order to perform his job as a \"cleaner\", or hit-man. His secluded world is shattered by the young girl named Mathilda who lives on the same floor as he does in an apartment building. When she turns to him for help, he learns about living a normal life, even if the circumstances which unite them are far from normal.\n\nThe performance delivered by then twelve-year old Natalie Portman as Mathilda is nothing short of brilliant. Her ability to relate to others with body movement and facial gestures is matched by few, she really brings raw emotion and believability to a difficult role. Mathilda and Léon are unexpectedly thrown together, but learn to value life from their chance encounter, and how valuable a friendship can be.\n\nJean Reno as Léon gives us a solemn and calculated character who sets all of his energy on his assignments until her is given something else to care about. Mathilda gives him the daughter that he never had, while Léon serves as a father and friend to her. Gary Oldman, as the corrupt DEA Agent Norman Stansfield, offers the viewers an amazingly wired and electrical performance which pushes the envelope. He moves the story along by his actions. Oldman offers us a memorable portrait of a sadistically obsessed man who stops short of nothing to get what he wants.\n\nThe Professional is what movie-making is all about. Without the overuse of special effects, a large shooting location, or a commercially star studded cast, we are given all that could possibly be asked for in a movie. Portman, Oldman, and Reno, along with Danny Aiello as the hit-contractor Tony remind us that there is no substitute for great acting. There are elements of comedy, drama, and action, and great original music by Eric Serra adds to the energy the film already encapsulates. The most impressive thing about the movie is its story which is basic but is maximized by all the other elements which go into the making of the movie. Simply put, an intense and impressive movie.'),(1393,83,'10/10','Masterful','tjcclarke','29 March 2004','I have long thought that owning films on DVD or video is a waste of money - you watch them once and after that they are left to fester at the back of a cupboard. Occasionally I make an exception - some films simply cannot be fully appreciated on just one viewing. Every time I watch Leon is as gripping and enjoyable as the first. Sad, funny, violent, incredibly touching - few films manage to tick all the boxes and even fewer are about hitmen.\n\nIt obviously helps when your leading man has as much screen presence as Jean Reno. Thin and wiry with toilet brush hair and a face like a bag of spanners, he is hardly your typical gun-toting action hero, but he has an innocence and compassion that makes you fall for him instantly. Leon\'s life is as simple as a small child\'s: TV, lashings of milk and the odd gangland assassination. He cannot read, he doesn\'t sleep, he hasn\'t the trappings of family or wealth (the fees for his hits are habitually trousered by his `benefactor\': sleazy small-time Italian gangster Tony (Danny Aiello)) - In short, he lives like a robot. And then he meets Mathilda.\n\nNormally I can\'t stand Hollywood kids. They are all doey-eyed, bouffant-haired brats who can cry on cue and are always ready with a cutesy, smart-alec comment that will cause their adult co-stars to tinkle with laughter or tousle their hair playfully. Often they are kidnapped and huge ransoms demanded while their parents go demented with worry. I for one am usually rooting for the kidnappers.\n\nNatalie Portman\'s Mathilda is the antithesis of these namby-pamby Dawson\'s Creek actors-in-waiting. For starters, she has something justifiable to gripe about, in that her entire family has just been slaughtered by Gary Oldman and his gang of crooked DEA officers. This is a bit of a blow, to say the least, but Mathilda takes it all in her stride and teams up with Leon in a bid for revenge. So begins one of the stranger relationships in silver screen history, but one of the most memorable.\n\nOn the face of it, a love story between a twelve year old girl and a hairy French hitman would raise a few eyebrows among more conservative movie-goers, but director Luc Besson handles it so beautifully, it seems like the most natural thing on earth. They are united in being totally alone in the world - indeed, the scene where Mathilda walks quietly down the corridor past the carnage in her apartment and knocks on Leon\'s door, imploring him in a tearful whisper to let her in is as breathtaking as it is heartbreaking. Leon is wary at first, but she soon wins him round and starts to gently bring him out of the shell.\n\nPortman is truly astonishing - one can almost forgive her for being a part of the appalling Star Wars prequels on the strength of this one performance. The iconic image of this tiny, grubby little girl clutching Leon\'s beloved plant and trotting to keep up with her lanky hero\'s giant strides is one that will live long in the memory.\n\nAiello and Oldman (at his sadistic, malevolent best) provide predictably excellent support, there is a wonderfully suspenseful yet satisfying ending - heck, there\'s even a decent Sting song playing over the credits - for this (if nothing else) it would be remiss of me to give Leon anything other than top marks.\n\n10/10'),(1394,83,'9/10','Visceral and intelligent - Besson\'s masterpiece','Twinsen61','19 January 2004','Leon is one of the most emotionally intense movies ever made. French director Luc Besson uses everything: actors, music, camera angles, lighting to create an unique experience - \"It\'s not realism, it\'s not naturalism - it\'s heightened reality\" as Gary Oldman very well put it.\n\nIn \"The making of The Professional\" Besson says \"If I imagine somebody in the street try to knock on my daughter, I kill the guy, in five seconds. I kill him, and I think \"It\'s in me, I\'m a beast!\" On this part we can\'t forget that a part of us, the genetic things inside are much, much older than The Ten Commandments\". He certainly uses visceral scenes to create very strong emotion in the movie - the blood running from Mathilda\'s nose or Stansfield\'s unforgettable \"EVERYONE!\" are just a couple of examples. The music and the sound are excellent and are used in a masterly fashion - you can hear Fatman\'s heart beating desperately or a low claustrophobic sound when Stansfield turns to look at Mathilda\'s father.\n\nHowever Leon does not work only on this primary level, it also has an intelligent story. It may seem to be almost a fairy-tale, but don\'t be fooled - just like his character Besson is serious. This movie has a message: without love we are dead, even if we don\'t see it. Only true love give meaning to our lives: \"everything else reminds me a big yogurt: warm and rancid\" as Mathilda says in the original script, which is available on the net under the name Leon Version 1. Is this true in \"real life\"? I don\'t know but this movie can make you wonder.\n\nThen of course there\'s the sensuality. It\'s hypocritical to deny it, the camera interacts with Mathilda in a mesmerising fashion. It\'s not sick and it\'s not degrading: it\'s art, subtle and beautiful.\n\nLeon is not perfect but it has so many great moments that all its flaws can be forgiven. It\'s a movie that really should not be missed, unless you are concerned with its amorality. And don\'t be - Leon is less violent than many action movies and the unusual relationship between the main characters is handled mostly with genuine feeling and tact.'),(1395,83,'10/10','Where are the accolades?','jcapelli','16 July 2002','This movie is rated 63 on the imdb top 250 movie list, showing that people obviously like this movie, and with good reason.

This is his benchmark, his classical composition. Look at the precise, intricate scenes. It\'s a symphony in cinema. Straight off, it\'s action. Intelligently shot, and scripted. It makes everything that follows hard to live upto. But it does so easily. It\'s stylish without being showy, it\'s deep without being sentimental. And it\'s just hugely enjoyable. Seeing the friendship between newly orphaned mathilda and skilled assasin leon bloom, is tenderly done. At risk of slipping into a sappy bond, besson keeps it easy on the emotions, without coming off as shallow.\n\nThe actors are all spot on, most notably the debut from a young natalie portman as mathilda. Showing an angry, sad, pent up, in love girl is no simple task but she breezes through it, touching all the right notes. And jean reno as the title character, is minimal but very effecting. Hard to understand, but easy to relate too. But gary oldman steals it, with his glorious overacting. He\'s as scary as he is determind. His line delivery is almost perfect. And his fate is very fitting. If only they made more intelligent action movies, then they could contend with this film.

Léon was Besson\'s first foray into international film production. The similarities, or parallels, between Nikita and Léon are undoubted. Both the central protagonists attempt to come to terms with their dysfunctionality, to society, against a background of violence, which they both continue to act upon as the agent of someone else. There is no clean difference (we may also include Le Dernier Combat for comparison.) The only difference is gender.\n\nI always found that until obtaining the \"Version Integral\" there was a character hole in the plot. The original cut released for US audiences was felt, by Besson, had an \"offending\" scene cut which ruined later scenes. The American test audiences hated it, seeing it as perverse and paedophiliac. The film was still panned by US critics as quasi-child pornography on general release. What it to be understood about this film, and this is what infuriated Besson, is that the film is about pure love. Not sex, which is all the Americans, could see.\n\nAnd so we have ascertained that the characters in Besson\'s films are, simply, great. Then there is the action which is all the grace and style of Nikita. Typical of Besson\'s style with fast action-shooting and violent characterisation. This has to be one of Jean Reno\'s and by far Natalie Portman\'s best screen performance. To me, Gary Oldman plays his part to the tee, said by some magazines to be the best screen bad guy - it is one of his best performances.\n\nStylisation and excess are hallmarks of Besson\'s work. Characters are larger than life. Décors are in excess of realism. Besson\'s characters lack psychological depth. \"The sumptuous and the ornate cohabit with the violent or the vulgar.\" Besson\'s use of excess is also extremely playful mixing violence with humour. Besson\'s work appeals to the tastes of popular culture and may not please that of the elite - arguably a reason for the rejection of his work by many intellectual film journals.\n\nI have yet to hear of a person putting a bad word against this film. There is nothing I can personally fault so I give this film 10/10, a score only two other somewhat different films hold in my IMDb list of 345 films - \"The Wizard of Oz\" and \"La Cité des Enfants perdu\".

But that also segues into the main and irredeemable issue with this movie; Leon and Mathilda\'s relationship.\n\nMathilda is insanely sexualized and Leon honestly doesn\'t do a ton to dismiss her feelings toward him. The movie on its own is disturbing, but knowing that Luc Besson married and impregnated a 15 year old girl when he was 31 really sheds a lot more light on the situation. In the international version of the film there are a lot more sexual situations with Leon and Mathilda, and in the original script, Besson went so far as to write in the two of them having sex. It\'s clear that this film is a reflection of Besson\'s own deranged life, and unfortunately the spectacular performances and every other great aspect of the film that garnered significant critical acclaim cannot redeem the film. I simply cannot overlook the depravity of a pedophilic relationship, portrayed as some beautiful thing.'),(1401,83,'10/10','A Brilliant Conflict','Sickfrog','14 August 1998','This film, better known in the U.S. as \"The Professional\", is a wonderful and intense film. Jean Reno plays his role as a \"cleaner\" with incredible subtlety. Leon tries to keep his emotions completely suppressed, yet Matilda (in an extraordinary performance by a young Natalie Portman, who is destined to become a very powerful actress into her adult life) bring out in him a new-found joy for life that accompanies his growing paternal instincts. But, the most dynamic element of this film is undeniably Gary Oldman\'s performance as a wildly sadistic and crooked DEA agent with his own narcotic-induced demons. His obsessions eventually lead him to the brink of absolute madness in his hunt for the cleaner. Truly, this is Oldman\'s finest performance to date, worthy of Oscar glory, though sadly forgotten. And so, Luc Besson did indeed top his triumph of \"La Femme Nikita\" by far with this masterpiece.

They\'re the standard \"badass\" character that kills people in order to collect a reward. Most hit men in films have been portrayed as cold, heartless villains (Boba Fett of Star Wars, Vincent of Collateral). Léon, however, flips this cliché on its end, as the hit-man is the kind-hearted protagonist who learns how to love, thanks to a little girl who shows up on his doorstep.\n\nLéon begins in a restaurant, with the assassin himself (Jean Reno) taking a contract from his boss Tony (Danny Aiello) to kill a man who\'s moving in on Tony\'s territory. The next 10 minutes become an enthralling cat and mouse game where Leon shows the viewers just why he is known as the cleaner: he is extremely good at this job. We also see Leon\'s human side, shown by his passion for milk, his affection for his plant (whom he calls his best friend) and when he becomes engrossed watching Singin\' in the Rain. Leon seems quite content with this life, not seeming to want anything more. That is, until he is forced to take custody of a twelve-year-old girl (Natalie Portman) whose entire family was cruelly massacred by a corrupt DEA agent (Gary Oldman). This is where Leon is forced to change his lifestyle for the little girl, and when she wishes to get into contract killing to avenge her brother, Leon becomes her mentor and protector.\n\nLuc Besson was both the director and screenwriter for Léon, and he proves with his sophomore effort that he is no one-hit wonder. Léon is a very fast paced movie, chronicling Leon\'s training of Mathilda, Mathilda\'s growing affection for contract killing (and for Leon himself), and the final standoff with Norman Stansfield. Despite all this, Léon also has time to throw in some slower scenes that develop Leon\'s and Mathilda\'s characters, expanding on their growing relationship and partnership.\n\nJean Reno does a very good job as Leon, portraying him both as an effective and frightening killing machine, and as a loving and caring father figure. There is almost a childlike innocence to Leon, with him being unable to read and not familiar with most American culture. Reno allows the audience to both sympathize with this character and respect him, an extremely challenging feat.\n\nNatalie Portman\'s breakout role as Mathilda is one of the greatest acted child roles in a film, period. Portman is able to portray childlike innocence combined with an above average intelligence and awareness of the world around her. Although she is young, she becomes extremely interested in Leon and his job, wanting revenge for the gross acts committed upon her. Make no mistake, Mathilda is the true star of this film, and Portman completely shines in the role.\n\nIn comparison to Jean Reno\'s fairly subdued performance as Leon, apparently Luc Besson wanted a more exciting and over-the-top antagonist for the film: enter Gary Oldman. Gary Oldman completely overacts his character of the crooked DEA cop, and he does it so wonderfully that he steals every scene he is in. This is without a doubt the greatest performance of this underrated actor\'s career, as the fun Oldman has with this role practically oozes out of the screen and infects anyone who watches him. While some critics criticized Oldman for his performance, it was actually spot on considering that the character of Stansfield is a drug-addicted psychotic cop who has no problem with murdering an innocent family to get what he desires. The only nitpick I have with Stansfield is his screen time is fairly small compared with Leon and Mathilda; nevertheless he completely steals the show when he does appear.\n\nThe plot of Léon is fairly straightforward compared to most action flicks, as there are no particular plot twists or double crossings. However, the simple plot works because this is not a plot driven movie, it is a character driven one. That\'s not to say there is no action in this movie, there are a few great action sequences (especially the spectacular police shootout in the film\'s climax), but the film mainly revolves around the growing affection between Leon and Mathilda, and how they change each others\' lives. Overall, Léon is an extremely well-made action/drama, and one of the best films of 1994.'),(1403,83,'9/10','Being a good hitman takes more than merely a willingness to lay down one\'s life.','Fella_shibby','24 September 2021','I first saw this in the late 90s.

A neighbour who it turns out is a professional hitman. She soon convinces him to train her to be his protégée.\n\nThis was French director Luc Besson\'s first American movie. It is a follow up of sorts to his earlier chic action-thriller Nikita (1990), with Jean Reno essentially reprising his role of a cleaner (professional assassin), although in this one he is playing a different character. Like all Besson\'s movies there is considerable style brought to the table with the action sequences once again particularly well-delivered. But perhaps the true revelation of the movie is Natalie Portman who puts in an extremely strong performance for such a young actress, full of charisma, humour and emotional depth. She plays off well against Reno, who is also impressive. Gary Oldman, on the other hand, is pretty grating and annoying mostly as the main villain, a character who is cartoonish and somewhat ridiculous overall.\n\nWhile I do find this film good quality for the most part, with great action sequences and some interesting characterisations, I have to express serious reservations about the director\'s cut, where Portman\'s young character is constantly trying to get Reno to sleep with her. Its majorly uncomfortable stuff and really entirely unnecessary. And while Léon does spurn her advances, it\'s never really very clear that he rejects her for entirely the right reasons. Seemingly in the original script, the characters do actually end up sleeping together, which we can only be grateful never actually made the final cut but it does make you wonder what Besson was thinking with all this questionable stuff. My advice would be to avoid the director\'s cut and watch this one in the trimmed version, which removes all this contentious material.'),(1406,83,'7/10','Some things I liked some I did not.','petarmatic','11 April 2014','I was very surprised to see that this film received such a high grade.

As a fan of the book, let me just say that\'s true but it\'s fine. The overarching story is the same. The fact of the matter is with a nearly 400 page novel packed full of pop culture references, some things would have to be cut to make it onto the big screen. Partially it\'s an issue of length. Partially it\'s just the reality that the planets were never going to fully align to allow use of many of the properties from the novel. Yes, I loved the 2112, WarGames, D&D, Joust, et al references from the novel as much as the next person, but still I felt that Spielberg captured the wonder and fun and the story of the novel accurately, even if he did so using different references. The are actually some things I even think were an improvement from the book, especially the way they re-imagined I-R0k. The bottom line is, if you\'re a book reader, just take this movie for what it is, an alternate version of the story, written by the same person who wrote the novel.\n396 out of 534 found this helpful.

He has been labeled both a peddler of popcorn and a saccharine manipulator (Those who say the latter have clearly forgotten Alex Kitner erupting in a geyser of blood in Jaws, exploding Nazi heads, the horrors of the Holocaust in Schindler and the river of corpses in War of the Worlds).\n\nThere are two Spielbergs. There\'s the man who makes somber, academy award winning dramas (Empire of the Sun, Saving Private Ryan, Munich, War Horse, Lincoln etc). Then\'s there\'s the 10 year old playing in the sand box (The Indy films, Hook, Jurassic Park, Tintin etc). What I enjoy most about the \'Berg, is how he can zigzag between disparate genres. But after a stretch of SF films (A.I, Minority Report and War of the Worlds), I was looking forward to a return to the free wheeling fun with Crystal Skull. It turned out to be an uncharacteristic dud that despite the boffo box office, proved to be deeply unpopular with fans of the series.\n\nThis made me cautious about Ready Player One. Had Spielberg lost his touch? I was wrong. This may be one of the most visually amazing and effortlessly fun films I\'ve seen in a long time. I have not read Ernest Cline\'s novel, so fans of the popular novel may have issues, but I rarely read the books before seeing the film.\n\nThe cast are great. Tye Sheridan are Olivia Cooke are the standouts. Mark Rylance and Simon Pegg are fun in supporting roles. Alan Silvestri\'s robust score is one of his most memorable. I miss John Williams, but it\'s still a great score. Longtime \'Berg collaborator Janusz Kaminski\'s cinematography is beautiful. And it\'s the only film where you\'ll see a DeLorean chasing a T-Rex on the big screen. That image alone is worth the ticket price.

Imaginative cinematography, interesting action, and a really killer of a sound track. That alone makes it a worthwhile viewing.\n\nThere is also a good story going on.

For the last decade or so his focus has been on more realistic period dramas and character pieces. His attempts at grand action spectacle (the underrated Tintin aside) were underwhelming. But who knew he had this left in him?\n\nThis film is an absolute blast. It seamlessly combines reality and animation into one big, exciting adventure. I\'m still not completely sure how it pulled it off. I was absolutely amazed at how seamlessly the film merged animation with reality (I\'d say only perhaps 1/3 of the film takes place in the \"real\" world) and gave the obviously digital environments emotional and kinetic weight. That\'s a very hard balance to pull off and this movie doesn\'t even raise a sweat. In fact, some of the best scenes revolve around the absurd mix of online and real existence. Pretty much every scene in Sorrento\'s soulless corporate HQ is a riot because of the seriousness with which they take their involvement in this silly online world, made even more ridiculous by the motions they all make in their VR suits as they react to unseen perils like well-dressed mimes.\n\nI have no doubt that this film will receive a lot of flak for its reliance on pop culture artifacts. And there\'s some truth to the criticism. The best scene in the movie is when one of the characters waits in an almost meditative trance during the fight scene until he cries out \"form of a gundam\" in Japanese and awesomeness ensues. Would this scene work as well if it hadn\'t been a recognizable brand? No question it wouldn\'t. And that goes for an infinite array of references, from the Iron Giant to the Delorean to an absolutely perfect Overlook Hotel to Chucky (\"Oh God, it\'s f*%@ing Chucky\" has got to be the second greatest line in the movie).\n\nBut to say that this is nothing but leaching off others\' success is unfair. The references are there for a reason. This is a Geek movie, and for geeks this sort of referencing is how they approach the universe. It\'d seem odd if there were no open pop culture references in a free-for-all online world. More to the point, the film has a lot to say about online culture and the isolating effect it has on people. The film isn\'t all pretty colors and film references, it deals with issues like how real the connections we form online actually are, the ever-decreasing distance between fantasy and reality, the importance of community involvement, and all sorts of identity issues that arise when we can hide behind avatars. Not that I\'d call the film overly deep or anything, but it\'s certainly more than just a collection of pop culture references thrown together with minimal plot.\n\nThe characters are all good fun. Parzival and his mate Aech are just like a lot of friends I know online, although Parzival\'s shallowness gives him a good obstacle to overcome. Art3mis is a bit more driven and has goals that take her further than just being the best at a video game. Parzival has a major cyber-crush on her, which is something of a problem. Daito and Shoto are somewhat more distant online rivals. All of them have great moments, but most come after their true selves get revealed around 2/3 of the way through the film. Some of them are very surprising (don\'t look at the cast list) and they are all funny together. Krennic\'s director Sorrento is a great villain. He\'s so full of himself and contemptuous that his appearance in-game as a muscular brute in a business suit dealing with mystical things he cares nothing about is a blast. And when he\'s cornered he can be hilariously practical. His online minion i-R0k is also priceless, the sort of super badass dude living in his mom\'s basement that you can only find in video games. Mark Rylance steals every scene he\'s in as the vaguely Wozniakian creator of the game. He\'s a rather sad figure, one who could never handle reality with such aplomb as he does the world he designed. I was surprsed to see Simon Pegg as his co-founder, a somewhat wasted role but nicel different from his more usual fare.\n\nAnd I really really didn\'t think Spielberg could pull this off. It\'s hard to write a love letter to your favorite films when you\'re the creator rather than consumer. I\'d have been more comfortable with some younger director who grew up on these films. I mean, his works aside I can\'t recall Spielberg ever displaying much interest in video games or Japanese pop culture (post-Kurosawa at least). Yet this film depends on its immense love of such elements. Perhaps a lot of it comes from the screenplay by the novel\'s author and Kal Penn, two people eminently qualified to pull this off. But it could never have succeeded without the passion of the maestro himself, and succeed it does. I went in with low expectations and had an absolute blast. But more importantly: I understood that reference.'),(1416,84,'6/10','Ready, set, go in the oasis','TheLittleSongbird','30 April 2018','Watched \'Ready Player One\' as someone who got a lot of pleasure out of the book and who loves a lot of Steven Spielberg\'s previous work. Despite it getting a fair share of criticism from fans of the book, that there were also enough good things said about it from critics and that many of my friends said it was worthwhile persuaded me enough to see it.\n\n\'Ready Player One\' left me with a mixed view (or just slightly above). As a book adaptation \'Ready Player One\' is severely wanting, having lost what made the book so special. As a film on its own, which is how it will be judged by me being a much fairer way to judge, \'Ready Player One\' is quite decent though with faults. It is nowhere near being one of Spielberg\'s best, a distinction he has not hit for a while (though for me he has not sold out), at the same time it is not one of his misfires either. To me \'Ready Player One\' is a middling effort.\n\nStarting with its good merits, \'Ready Player One\' looks incredible. One of those films where one is truly immersed in a world filled with a non-stop sense of wonder. The Oasis depiction is rich in wonder, adventure, vibrancy and imagination, the cool factor is also high. The special effects are pretty spectacular. Alan Silvestri provides the best score in a Spielberg film since \'War Horse\' (and one of the best in the past fifteen years or so), providing a lot of energy and thrills.\n\nNostalgia is rife with inspired cameos of numerous significant cultural characters, like the \'Jurassic Park\' dinosaur and the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, and even more numerous cultural references, highlights being the \'Back to the Future\' Delorean and the Overlook Hotel from \'The Shining\'. There is enough wit and intrigue in the writing and the story has many instances where it is fun and laden in thrills, the chase scenes especially. Particularly standing out is the one switching between real world and the Oasis. Spielberg delivers on the spectacle, the world building and the visual style.\n\nAlthough not complex or subtle, the characters are engaging enough. Olivia Cooke is very appealing and shares charming chemistry with Tye Sheridan. Simon Pegg is great fun, while Ben Mendelssohn has a whale of a time as the villain and Mark Rylance beautifully and terrifically provides the emotion and soul that is not quite there elsewhere.\n\nHowever, the story does tend to be lacking. There is just too little structurally in a very long, too long even, running time, no matter how many cultural references there are. With trying to take on a lot, character depth and development are sacrificed in favour of spectacle and nostalgia. Luckily those are done well, but one does wish that the characters were more interesting with the lead character in particular not having much growth.\n\nThis does affect somewhat Tye Sheridan\'s performance, shining in the chemistry with Cooke but elsewhere it\'s somewhat bland and cold. The script does have wit and intrigue but it can also be exposition heavy, and it is here where the writing feels rambling, unnatural and clumsy. There are aspects of Spielberg\'s directing that comes over well.\n\nUnfortunately, what doesn\'t is the complete command of the material and giving the film enough soul and emotion (Rylance cannot bring those qualities out all on his own, no matter how well he did them). Some of the messaging is heavy-handed and the finale is far too overly-sentimental and where the sketchiness of the character development and overall depth is most betrayed.\n\nOverall, diverting and entertaining enough but was expecting more. 6/10 Bethany Cox');

The two had a big falling out leaving Halliday in total control of the Oasis. But he died, and his dying \"game\" was to devise a devious competition that left a trail of three virtual keys in the Oasis leading to an \'easter egg\': which if found would provide the finder with total ownership of the Oasis and the trillions of dollars that it is worth.\n\nBut the game is not only played by amateur \"gunters\" (egg-hunters) like our hero Wade Watts (Tye Sheridan, \"X-Men: Apocalypse\") and his in-Oasis flirting partner Samantha (Olivia Cooke, \"Me and Earl and the Dying Girl\"); there are big corporate game-hunters involved like IoI (that\'s eye-oh-eye, not one-oh-one as I assumed from the trailer) who fill warehouses with combinations of nerd-consultants and professional game players to try to find the keys before anyone else. Which hardly seems fair does it? Ruthless boss Sorrento (Ben Mendelsohn, \"Rogue One\") and his tough-as-nails hench-woman F\'Nale Zandor (Hannah John-Kamen, \"Tomb Raider\") really couldn\'t give a toss!\n\nWhat follows is two-hours of high-octane game-play and eye-popping 3D (it is good in 3D by the way) that melds a baseline of \"Avatar\" with soupçons of \"Tron\", \"Minority Report\" and Dan Brown novels. But its a blend that works.\n\nI was afraid as I said that CGI would squash flat any hope of character development and story, and - yes - to be sure this is \'suppressed\' a bit. You never get to really know many of the \'pack\' members to any great level other than Wade and Samantha. And exactly what drives the corporate protagonists, other than \"corporate greed\", is not particularly clear. What gives the film heart though are the performances of \"Actor P\" and (particularly) \"Actor R\", who again steals every scene he is in. For their limited screen time together, the pair bounce off each other in a delightful way.\n\nI have to make a confession at this point that I spent the whole film thinking \"Miles Teller is way too old for the part of Wade\"! Tye Sheridan (who I think *does* bear a likeness!) is actually much more age appropriate, and is fine in the role. But the star performance for me, out of the youngsters at least, was Oldham\'s-own Olivia Cooke, who has a genuinely magnetic screen presence. She is most definitely a name to watch for the future.\n\nAlmost unrecognizable in the role is the woman of the hour Letitia Wright (\"Black Panther\", \"Thor: Ragnarok\") as Wade\'s inventor friend Reb.\n\nThe story, although simple and quite one-dimensional, in the main intrigues: there is nothing like a Mario-style chase for keys to entertain when it is done well (I am so old and crusty that in my day it was \"Manic Miner\" on a ZX-Spectrum!).\n\nAnd there\'s not just one \"Easter Egg\" in this film: the film is rammed to the rafters with throwbacks to classic pop-culture icons of past decades, and particularly the 80\'s.... the film could have been subtitled \"I Heart 80\'s\". Some of these are subliminal (Mayor Goldie Wilson anyone?), and others are more prominent but very clever: \"The Zemekis cube\" and \"The Holy Hand Grenade\" being prime examples. This is a film that deserves buying on Blu-ray and then slo-mo-ing through! The nostalgia extends to the music by Alan Silvestri, with occasional motifs from his most famous soundtrack!\n\nFor me though, the highspot of the film though is a journey into a recreation of a classic \'80\'s film which - while a scary sequence, earning for sure its 12A UK rating - is done with verve and chutzpah.\n\nAlthough a little overlong (2 hours 20 mins) and getting rather over-blown and LOTR-esque in the finale, the ending is very satisfying - roll on Tuesdays and Thursdays!\n\nSpielberg\'s recent films have been largely solid and well-constructed watches (\"The Post\" and \"Bridge of Spies\" for example) but they have been more niche than mainstream box office draws. I firmly predict that \"Ready Player One\" will change that: here Spielberg has a sure-fire hit on his hands and word of mouth (rather than the ho-hum trailer) should assure that.\n\n(For the graphical review, please visit bob-the-movie-man.com or One Mann\'s Movies on Facebook.

Our hero, Wade Watts, fills in the details while climbing past his grungy homes of his town, \"the stacks,\" where trailer parks are piled on top of each other sky-high. Things are so miserable in Wade\'s world, everyone escapes to play in an immersive virtual reality game known as the Oasis. Its founder, James Halliday is worshipped like a god until his death some years before. However, before he left the mortal world, the creator left behind a series of games that would reward the winner with the prize of the keys to his virtual kingdom.\n\nThe book was a fast paced adventure that took its time to geek out on all of the 80\'s pop culture references but the film doesn\'t do that. . Spielberg doesn\'t have Wade (the titular character) talk audiences through it, and he doesn\'t spell out the references, he just quickly stamps down the Delorean in the middle of a action sequence and then continues onward. Fans can pause it frame by frame and analyse it thoroughly looking for the flux capacitor on the dashboard, checking the plates, and scanning for extra bonus material. Even to people who\'ve never seen the Back to the Future movies and aren\'t vibing on the connection, the car doesn\'t need explaining. It\'s just a sleek piece of visual energy, one breathless element among dozens of others. That\'s why the movie works better than the books in terms of visual style and nostalgia.\n\nThe thin plot and the not so well done shallow characters make the film to be just a pop culture reference filled visual treat. Several plot holes( If movement is required to move an avatar in the game, how do people play in the Oasis while standing in their living rooms?) and a non-existent character arc makes it a fun, but a tangible watch. They\'re all already heroes, the big bad is evil from start to finish.\n\nThe story\'s breakneck speed, it\'s never ending references, make it a fun, exciting watch.'),(1419,84,'9/10','Sorry nerds, this is for the rest of us.','bradhubert','2 April 2018','Its hard for me to believe all of the one and two star reviews for this film on here from people who are obsessed with the book.

One girl was actually complaining that she disliked it for the same reason she can\'t watch Game of Thrones, because it\'s not faithful to the source material.\n\nWell I\'m sorry that your trip out of your parent\'s basement wasn\'t as satisfying as you hoped, but for the rest of us who haven\'t read the book and are not obsessive video game or pop culture fans it was a great movie. There\'s enough references for everyone to enjoy the story, but not enough to confuse the majority of the audience.\n\nThe visual effects are stunning and while the story may be wrapped up a little too neatly, its still a stunning tour de force from the best director in the business.\n\nThis was a great film with an excellent warning about the overuse video games and virtual reality.

T., or the useless references of movies like The Shining (which has nothing to do with videogames but who cares).\n\nAnother thing that really stood out is when the love interest says she\'s ugly in real life and of course they cast a beautiful actress in the role and give her an oversized mole. It\'s the typical milquetoast approach of Hollywood movies.\n\nIf there ever is a coloumn about \"Spielberg\'s worst movies\", this and Bridge of spies are definitely in it.'),(1421,84,'6/10','An Entertaining VR Movie that Ignores Real-World Problems','Jared_Andrews','11 April 2018','If you are just looking for a fun movie with expertly directed action sequences, wow moments, and beautiful effects, this is the movie for you. If you are the type of person who cannot help but analyze every movie you see, Ready Player One will cause you some problems.\n\nSpielberg is a master of wow moments. He knows how to capture characters in moments of awe, and he knows how to make the audiences respond with dropped jaws and bewildered expressions. That\'s why the guy is one of the most financially successful filmmakers of all time. Watching this particular film of his makes it easy to see, even if you weren\'t already aware of his reputation, that Spielberg works the camera like few others can.\n\nThat said, this movie is not perfect.\n\nThe premise, at least on its surface, seems wonderful. A teenage boy (Tye Sheridan), named Wade Watts (because it sounds like a superhero\'s alter ego) in the near future plays an ultra-version of a virtual reality game to escape his grim real-world existence. Everyone in his world does. And we can see why. The VR world (The Oasis) is awesome.\n\nWade spends his time obsessing over a contest in The Oasis left behind by its now deceased creator. The winner of the contest claims a kajillion dollars (or something like that) and control over The Oasis. With a prize like that, Wade is obviously not the only person trying to win.\n\nSo, one day he meets a girl who uses the player name Art3mis (a charming Olivia Cooke) and joins her group. Together they try to win the contest before the evil company does and puts ads in The Oasis (which doesn\'t seem that bad). Then blah, blah, blah. You can imagine how this all turns out. If not, great, you\'ll be surprised.\n\nThis all seems fine and fun until you dissect the movie even a little bit. The message the movie sends is that this is all about friendship, which is total BS. Friendship is important, sure, but in this world, there is more at stake. Wade and much of the country live in terrible poverty, and a couple mega-businesses control the state of everything. It\'s a miserable reality with problems that we see today, except amplified by 100.\n\nIt\'s irresponsible and insulting that the movie pretends that this future world will be okay as long as The Oasis doesn\'t have ads. People still live in poverty. The world is still in shambles.\n\nWhat I\'m saying is, the movie has a problem with stakes. The stakes of this future world are enormous and dire, but the movie chooses to ignore them. That doesn\'t sit right with me.\n\nOne other issue, and this one is minor, is that this movie seems like it\'s made for kids, but it makes a bunch of 80s nostalgia references. Does that make sense? I don\'t think today\'s 14-year-olds care about Duran-Duran.\n\nEven looking past the social blinders this movie chooses to wear and the confusing nostalgia choices, the third act drags horribly. I spaced out for a good ten minutes and didn\'t miss a thing.\n\nIn spite of all that, this movie has moments of ecstasy. If you are going to see, and I\'m not sure if you should, see it in a theater. If you can avoid analyzing the movie and simply enjoy it from a pure entertainment standpoint, you may love it.'),(1422,84,'8/10','A Nerd\'s Nerd Film','ThomasDrufke','13 April 2018','Ready Player One is quite possibly the biggest \"nerd\'s nerd film\". What I mean by that is that sure the film can be appreciated by the general public, but there\'s no question that the large part of the population that goes to see it won\'t be able to truly appreciate the ins and outs of this Easter egg filled movie. Dozens and probably even closer to hundreds of hidden gems fill this Sci-fi feature helmed by one of the all-time greatest directors, Steven Spielberg. If there\'s ever a film you wish you could pause, zoom-in, and rewind while in the theater, it\'s Ready Player One.\n\nThere is of course, the disappointing element of the film you have to get over, which is that a good chunk of the film (maybe 75%) is in CGI. Once you get passed the fact that the characters you\'re supposed to grapple onto, and the environments they inhabit, are entirely fake, then there\'s not much stopping you from having a blast. I thought the performances by Tye Sheridan, Olivia Cooke, and Ben Mendelsohn were all very good, and in Cooke\'s case, great. The effects and cinematography were about as good as you\'re going to get without going over budget. And the script was above average.\n\nHowever, the real journey you go to the theater for is the mystery, easter eggs, and the surprises. Boy were there a ton of them here. There\'s one particular scene, which was somehow not spoiled by any marketing or journalist, that is one of the coolest film sequences I have seen in quite some time. And Spielberg really does a nice job of appealing to the older generations as well as the newer generations. What a ride this film was.\n\n8.8/10'),(1423,84,'10/10','Virtual Virtuosity','3xHCCH','24 March 2018','\"Ready Player One\" was first a sci-fi novel written by Ernest Cline, published in 2011. Warner Bros. saw so much potential in this novel, they bought the rights for its film version a full year before it was even published. Cline adapted his own book into a script, with the assistance of veteran screenwriter Zak Penn. With Steven Spielberg signing on to direct in 2015, this film had all the ingredients for a blockbuster film.\n\nIt is 2045. Wade Watt was an orphaned young man who lived in the \"Stacks,\" a dystopian slum neighborhood in Columbus, Ohio. Like everyone else at that time, Wade spent his days going inside the OASIS, a virtual world where people can do anything they desire. As his avatar Parzival, Wade wanted to win the game challenge left by the late OASIS inventor James Halliday -- where anyone who can win three keys leading to an Easter Egg hidden somewhere in the OASIS will inherit full ownership of the Halliday\'s invention.\n\nI first saw lead actor Tye Sheridan in 2015 in two thematically diverse films like \"Scout\'s Guide to the Zombie Apocalypse\" (MY REVIEW) and \"Dark Places\" (MY REVIEW). He then made a strong impression as the young Cyclops in \"X-Men: Apocalypse\" (2016). His role here as Wade Watts is bound to launch this young 21-year old actor into super-stardom. Although half of the time, we see him as his avatar Parzival, Sheridan ably carried the whole film on his shoulders in both the action and drama components of his role.\n\nHis group of friends in the OASIS were a diverse bunch of very skilled video game geeks. Lena Waithe played Helen Harris, whose OASIS identity Aech was a musclebound male techie and Wade\'s best friend. Win Morisaki and Philip Zhao play Japanese gamers Toshiro and Akihide whose avatars were samurai Daito and ninja Shoto respectively. Olivia Cooke played Samantha Cook, a rebel activist in real life and Wade\'s cyber crush Art3mis virtually. Although the book does not have a follow-up, it does not seem impossible if we see this group again in a future sequel for further adventures of The High Five.\n\nMark Rylance was not easily recognized in his unkempt long-haired geek make-up as the eccentric James Halliday, the timid genius who developed a virtual world to escape the loneliness of the real world. Simon Pegg played Halliday\'s only friend and business partner Ogden Morrow, who later became estranged due to their divergent philosophies.\n\nVeteran character actor Ben Mendehlson played the main antagonist character Nolan Sorrento, CEO of the Innovative Online Industries or IOI, manufacturers of virtual reality hardware. He hired an entire army of virtual warriors in order to win Halliday\'s Easter Egg in order for IOI to gain control of the whole OASIS. There was so much subtle tongue-in-cheek humor in his portrayal of a ruthless character. T.J. Miller stole scenes as virtual mercenary i-R0k whom Sorrento hired to do his virtual mayhem.\n\nThis film was so much fun to watch with all the pop culture references that abound in it. You\'d need repeated watching of this film to catch all those little juicy details hidden in the scenes and the dialogue. You will see King Kong, Mecha-Godzilla, Gundam, the Iron Giant in all their glory, and catch glimpses of the Batmobile, the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, Tony Manero\'s disco moves and many more.\n\nThe musical soundtrack was steeped in 1980s pop songs, beginning with Van Halen\'s \"Jump\" from the opening scene, and citations of a-ha and Duran Duran. There were rich references to 1980s movies with mentions of names like John Hughes, Ferris Bueller and Buckaroo Banzai. Parzival\'s car is a DeLorean from \"Back to the Future.\" There was entire elaborate segment dedicated to a tribute to the horror classic \"The Shining\" (Stanley Kubrick, 1980), in what is probably the most fun part of the whole film.\n\nWatching a film like this in 3D IMAX is very much worth the additional ticket expense. The computer-generated world of OASIS really came alive three-dimensionally for the audience as they are drawn in and immersed into what is practically what the characters were virtually seeing and experiencing in their heads.\n\nFrom the 1970s all the way to the 1990s, Steven Spielberg had given us some of the most engaging adventure films of all time both by young film fans and old -- \"Jaws\" (1974), \"Close Encounters of the Third Kind\" (1977), \"Raiders of the Lost Ark\" (1981), \"E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial\" (1982), \"Jurassic Park\" (1993).

There were so many pop culture characters and obscure characters that only true nerds of movies, gaming, comics, etc. would recognize.

You feel like Marty Mcfly in Back to the Future - going back in time, only in this case - a journey filled with absolute nostalgia of pop culture from the 80s and possible some early 90s.\n\nThe entire time you can spot references or so called easter eggs throughout the entire film. You get that feeling of being a kid again and reliving your childhood (if you grew up in those times) on a roller coaster ride! The nostalgia is not just other things you see throughout the film but also from some of the lines the characters in the story use, their gestures, and even clothing apparel! Not to mention, the music!!! What a great choice and what better than using Van Halen\'s \"Jump\" in the trailer to let you know you\'re about to step back into 80s!\n\nThe film displays beautiful vivid colors of non stop special effects and the action is very consistent without long dwelling scenes of nonsense found in other films. You feel like you\'re enjoying an absolute retro filled vibe through the movie yet it doesn\'t feel outdated at all - it feels modern and current with the times! It\'s like Tron meets Wreck it Ralph w/ a small touch of maybe say The Wizard!\n\nThe film was an awesome refresher to all the recent most disappointing films in Hollywood, and that old school still has a great touch of simplicity but also powerful creativity that many film makers could learn from today, a message to film makers today - when you over complicate films or stories you tend to lose a lot of quality in the fun factor. The film is NOT overly cheesy and doesn\'t make you cringe or soo bad its good in examples of other films like \"The Wizard\", \"Super Mario Bros\", \"Street Fighter\", \"Dead or Alive\", \"Pixels\" or \"Double Dragon\" etc. No, this film got it right!\n\nThe only thing I will say is that it did feel like they could have elaborated on some essential things that are missing from the book that people have mentioned but hey, the film is only roughly 2 hours, its not enough time to cram all of that.

Still, this world is guaranteed to entertain fans of nostalgia both young and old, even if the older crowd will find the basic plot formulaic and predictable.\n\nThe film is sort of like how \"Tron\" was back in 1982 if you replaced the made-up characters and environments with those of actual pop cultural icons. The future setting of the film is so displeasing that the majority of the population has chosen to enjoy their time inside the OASIS, a virtual reality video game where you can basically do anything or be anything. The socially awkward creator of this game James Halliday, now deceased, has left a three-step challenge that if completed, will grant the victor access to control the OASIS. The story follows Wade Watts and his friends on a quest to complete the challenge before an evil corporation that is bent on seizing control of the OASIS through the completion of the challenges and turning it into what would essentially be a pop-up ad heaven (or hell, depending on your perspective).\n\n\"Ready Player One\" is a great visual experience first and foremost. The use of nostalgia feels more as a means to be realistic rather than a means to capitalize on one\'s childhood. There are plenty of moments that are just there to be pointed out as Easter eggs, but it never distracts from the core story. The adventure inside the OASIS is fun and immersive in the classic Spielberg sense with the balance of seriousness and humor being on point. The film also does manage to throw in good messages and satire about society being obsessed with trying to escape the real world, often at the consequence of losing touch with the things of true value in the real world. The best example of this is the idea of teenagers developing a \"relationship\" online despite never seeing each other face to face. As one character quotes, \"You only see and hear what I want you to.\" The message is also pushed via Halliday who chose to devote so much time to his own pop culture safe space, that he lost a close friend and a chance for love in the process. So in a sense, pop culture does serve an actual purpose. Still, purpose or not, it is very gitty to see so much on screen at once. I particularly jumped onto the fanboy train once the heroes entered the second stage of the challenge, which involves navigating a certain popular horror film which I shall not reveal.\n\nThis is definitely a film for kids, who will likely walk away with this ironically becoming a nostalgic part of their own childhoods. Adults will also have a lot of fun, but as an adult, I can\'t help but notice some things. For one, there really isn\'t much to the core plot. Outside the OASIS, things are pretty basic. The human characters are mostly just base level and, oddly enough, are overshadowed by the colorful avatar counterparts. The plot of an evil corporation, an underground resistance, and the inevitable revolution of little people vs elites has been done time and time before and sadly the film does nothing to mix up that narrative. The story goes pretty much where you expect outside of the visual package that is unique to \"Ready Player One\'s\" style. The characters aren\'t bad and all the actors are great, but only two really walk away with memorable depth: Watts\'s love interest Art3mis and OASIS creator James Halliday. Also, the exposition was very heavy at the beginning of the film. While some was necessary, there did come a point where I felt the voiceover narration from Watts was going overboard.\n\nMost of this is just nitpicking as none of that ruins the overall fun factor of the picture. The world of the OASIS is worth price of admission and some good, timely messages do manage to speak through without feeling preachy or political. The fact that the nostalgia feels like it has an artistic purpose really impressed me, but I can\'t deny I will likely indulge into more viewings just to find all the pop culture Easter eggs I likely missed...for fanboy satisfaction.\n\nRecommended.

Maybe he wanted to avoid the trap of the movie never living up to its source, so he decided to take the thing in an entirely different direction so it would be harder to compare the two. In any case, what lives on the screen resembles the novel only in the barest of outlines. Gone is the cleverness of the novel and its geeky reverence for 1980s pop culture. In its place is a soulless attempt to recreate one of those adventure movies from that decade, like \"Goonies\" or \"Back to the Future,\" but without the sensibility to pull it off. Again, very odd given that the director of this film, Steven Spielberg, practically redefined the adventure sci-fi movie. But he feels like the wrong match for this material. The movie is like watching a movie about 80s nostalgia made by someone who doesn\'t feel it and is trying to manufacture it based on a guess as to what it might feel like.\n\nMostly the film is just visually overwhelming.

Most movies nowadays are full of wire work, sci-fi, etc. often topped with icing made of needless or predictable background stories that add nothing. For example the beautiful girlfriend who gives the moral speeches or the troubled teenage daughter, who aren\'t present here.\n\nNothing of that is in John Wick. John Wick adds hardly a story, no character development, no needless character or background, no misplaced drama, no misplaced humor and not too much eye candy, nothing of that. What John Wick offers is action, action and more action. In fact, it is one long action scene, with some lines and close ups added. But that is not a problem. The directors promise action and deliver. While delivering they made it look good and convincing, without trying to be more, and they\'re smart enough to give the movie a satisfying beginning and ending.\n\nAnd for those who claim that Keanu Reeves is a horrible actor..... you are right. But his blank expression is perfect for this movie. Leave the acting to the bad guys and the delicious guest part for Willem Dafoe.\n\nIf you\'re tired of movies with forced drama or loaded with CGI, John Wick will be a pleasant wake-up call.'),(1434,85,'10/10','The best action revenge film of all time from 2014 so far!','ivo-cobra8','19 November 2015','John Wick (2014) is the best revenge flick from Keanu Reeves of 2014 from The Matrix (1999) to John Wick (2014) another action fast paced, Entertaining slick action packed film, which kind I have never seen before. It is a very fun, straightforward action movie with an 80\'s sensibility. It\'s nice to see Keanu doing these types of roles again. It is one of my personal favorite Keanu Reeves movies. Keanu Reeves is a bad ass what a great action packed blood packed film. Movies should really learn from this on how to make a decent action film, especially with the crap we are getting today like escape plan bullet to the head and such. This film to me is the greatest action film to come out in this century. Keanu was phenomenal the action was so fast paced and exciting my jaw literally dropped as Keanu took out all the bad guys! I personally think this film is better then all Taken films combined. It was simply brilliant, it was made for 20 million dollars and I am glad it made 40 million in the US. I think this film deserved to make 100 million!\n\nOld school action with no shaky cam. Definitely the best stunt-man-turned-director-debut I\'ve ever seen. The story is set about John Wick (Keanu Reeves) a retired assassin, who gets dragged back into his field when the Russian Mob put a hit out on him, but instead of killing John, they steal his classic Mustang and kill his newly acquired puppy. This sets John out to exact revenge on the whole mob in a no nonsense kind of way...multiple shots to the chest and one to the head for good measure type of justice. I\'ve never seen a film where the gun play is this to the point and precise as this. I don\'t know what the body count is, but it\'s gotta be up there...way up there. Oh...and another thing...they actually reload the guns. Don\'t see that that often in films. It\'s got an all star cast of cameo/small roll characters, from Ian McShane, William Dafoe, and John Leguizamo, and I swear one of the bad guy henchman is that \"Mayhem\" Insurance guy. One of the Best Movie, that Keanu Reeves ever made. From start to finish. Non stop action, all scenes look very realistic. ( The best action movie of the year. )\n\nI Love this movie so much I think the people behind this movie made a great astonish action movie. There are other things in the movie that I love so much. I even think John Wick is so much better than 47 Ronin (2013) that Keanu Reeves made. The most that I love in this movie is Adrianne Palicki as Ms. Perkins I think she did one of the best job portraying and playing the most memorable female assassin I have ever seen. Ms. Perkins made me realized and inspired me that there are a lot of women who choose occupation as a female assassin hired by the mob. There were a lot of female actresses who played an assassin but I have never see any women portrayed like that. Adrianne Palicki is a bad ass! She even played Lady Jaye in the G.I. Joe Team\'s covert operations a specialist in the movie G.I. Joe: Retaliation (2013) one of my favorite movies. The fight sequence between John Wick and Viggo Tarasov is real and very realistic I did not see any CGI in it. This wouldn\'t be an action movie without some action. There\'s plenty of it, and it\'s perfectly done. The The stunts are completely insane in scale. There is a lot of gun play and powder even the guys reload guns. There are even Daniel Bernhardt from Bloodsport II and The Matrix Reloaded in it. And he was perfect in here and the fight scenes with Keanu Reeves were well done by him. This is the first time In the movie I see Willem Dafoe been the good guy. I haven\'t seen him in decades playing the good guy since Platoon (1986) my favorite Vietnam war movie!\n\nThe last thing about the movie I want to say that John Wick was a dog lover and I love dogs. I love how he avenge the puppy\'s death by mobsters who killed him and than he saved another puppy from the animal shelter when he was wounded. He wasn\'t a superhero without any bruises on him he was wounded. Keanu Reeves did a wonderful job better than he did in Knock Knock (2015) I only hope they want screwed up the sequel and making much better action movie than the first was.\n\nWhen sadistic young thugs senselessly attack John Wick (Keanu Reeves)-a brilliantly lethal ex-assassin-they have no idea they\'ve messed with the wrong guy. With New York City as his bullet-riddled playground, Wick embarks on a merciless rampage, hunting down his adversaries with the skill and ruthlessness that made him an underworld legend That is the main plot the rating I am giving this movie is a 10/10 because It deserves it.'),(1435,85,'Special-K88','delivers if taken for what it is','30 July 2020','Was this review helpful?

When he and his dog (really the last meaningful thing he has left) fall victim to a scummy group of Russian mobsters, he emerges from his shell with vengeance on his mind. Slow and ambiguous at first, but reveals more as it goes along, and once it kicks into gear it rarely lets up with plenty of stylized, visceral action scenes, an impressive arsenal of weaponry, plus sly direction and editing that give it the feel of a violent music video at times. Preposterously fun to watch, it just doesn\'t have much of a story at its disposal, not to mention all the over-the-top bloodletting and mayhem eventually becomes redundant.

In the film of the same name, he goes back into action shooting up bad guys in a city where it seems that the cops have all simultaneously taken a vacation. Played by surprisingly youthful quinquagenarian Keanu Reeves, John Wick\'s style of shooting baddies is reminiscent of my days playing Whac-A-Mole, Duck Hunt, or any of those arcade games with the plastic guns. Wick is a vengeant superman, and this is the basis of the entire movie. Although he doesn\'t have a clear weakness that can be exploited like most heroes, Wick does get into enough trouble for the audience to be sincerely worried about him.\n\nIf you\'re planning on seeing John Wick because you like movies with clever or meaningful story lines, then you\'re going to be disappointed. If you are looking for raw well- choreographed action and machismo, then look no further. House Greyjoy\'s Alfie Allen stands out as villainous Russian mafia brat Iosef Tarasov, and Michael Nyqvist (Girl with the Dragon Tattoo) plays Viggo, his mob boss father. Adrianne Palicki, Willem Dafoe, Ian McShane and Dean Winters round out a strong supporting cast.\n\nOverall, I enjoyed John Wick as a pure action film. It doesn\'t have a storyline like The Matrix or Speed, but it was visually entertaining and the simplicity of the story allowed for appreciation of the action. This movie is manly and primitive, and proves that at the age of 50, Keanu Reeves can still mix it up as an action star.'),(1438,85,'8/10','I\'m Thinking I\'m Back','ThomasDrufke','24 February 2015','John Wick is one of those few movies a year that seemed like it would be absolutely terrible, but when you finally sit down and watch it, turns out to be incredible. Not only is it one of the most fun films of the year, but it\'s so much different than the action films we have today. It doesn\'t try to be inventive or over-the-top, it just plays to it\'s strengths.\n\nI have never been a huge fan of Keanu Reeves. Even in The Matrix, which is a great film, his acting falls pretty flat to me. He hasn\'t showed me anything that can make him a true thespian on screen. But as John Wick, he\'s perfect. The role doesn\'t call for anything more than just being a likable bada**. Wick is a man dealing with the death of his wife and retirement of his past associations with assassins of sort. He finally feels like he get\'s closure with his wife and then it\'s all ripped away from him by the very gangsters he was once affiliated with. He goes on an absolute killing rampage. To say the body count adds up is an understatement. Wick goes to great lengths to find the people who took everything from him, but it\'s not exactly easy for him. Being someone who just came out of retirement means you may be a little rusty, well Wick is definitely that. That\'s one of the many things I appreciated about this film. It never seemed like he was blowing through these guys without danger. Sure he effortlessly kills plenty, but he also struggles with a few as well.\n\nKilling a cute little dog would tick off anyone, so I don\'t blame the character for being mad, but I\'m not sure there needed to be this many deaths. There are plenty of innocent security guards who die at the hands of Wick. At times, it just felt like a little too much for a revenge film. But I really loved all of John\'s interactions with people from his past. They all seem to be as surprised that Wick is killing again, as we are that this film turned out to be good. I thought it was a nice touch that the police officer simply let the fact that there were a bunch of dead people in Wick\'s apartment, go. Alfie Allen plays the main villain, and it seemed as though his storyline is very similar to that of Game of Thrones. He\'s constantly under-appreciated and so he wants to prove himself, but ends up doing something terribly stupid. It was also nice to see Bridget Regan from Agent Carter briefly pop up.\n\nBut besides the fact that the script was pretty weak and the body count was pretty high, the film is just awesome. The \'Drive\' sounding music and score to go along with the breathtaking action sequences made for one helluva ride. Keanu Reeves should stick to these less demanding and fun action roles.

I was told by a friend this was good but it\'s been awhile since I liked a Keanu movie so I was hesitant to try it. Retired hit-man John Wick (Keanu Reeves) loses his wife to cancer. After her funeral he receives a puppy she left him. A few days later some thugs, led by the son of a Russian gangster John used to work for, break into John\'s house. They beat him up, take the keys to his beloved car, and kill the puppy. They did this not knowing who he was; they just wanted the car. Now John Wick is out for revenge and the Russian gangster is trying to save his son\'s life by sending killers after John.\n\nKeanu\'s great here. Glad to see him doing something watchable again. Willem Dafoe, Alfie Allen, Ian McShane, and Lance Reddick lead a good supporting cast. Michael Nyqvist was made to play villains. Even Adrianne Palicki was good. Oh and hey the beat-up guy from the Allstate commercials is in this. The stuff with the hotel for assassins and the way they all know each other was pretty funny. About the only problem I had with it was the unrealistic scene where the bad guy finally gets the upper hand on the \'hero\' and doesn\'t kill him. This sort of thing is common in movies but it\'s always unbelievable and reminds me of the old James Bond villains. This is easily the best action movie this year. Possibly the best straight action movie since the first Taken. English-speaking action movies, that is. It doesn\'t reinvent the genre or anything but it\'s entertaining.'),(1440,85,'9/10','Keanu Brings a quiet believability to this action throwback','potablepictureshow','19 December 2014','John Wick had been out awhile and at first I had little interest in seeing it as, for me, Keanu Reeves is generally whatever the opposite of a selling point is. However I kept hearing about how this was a bit of a throw back of an action movie and upon reading the connection between the director and Keanu, I thought I would have to put aside my preconceived notions and give this movie a shot.\n\nThe movie had two ex-stunt men (one of which was Keanu Reeves\' former stunt double) helming this film. This resulted in a lot of practical effects instead of heavy reliance on green screen. Also familiarity with Reeves likely left the directors with a base knowledge with how far they could push the star. This left the film\'s action scenes clean, realistic, to the point, and a hell of a lot of fun to watch.\n\nIf I was going to break down the film\'s format, well it is of the \"semi-generic Punisher type, ex bad ass comes out of retirement to take on other bad asses\" type variety. It was 75% Japanese yakuza film, 20% Film Noir, and 5% video game. One stylistic element that jumped out at me right away was the choice to go with a narrow scope of field for focus. At first I thought maybe this was the projector in the theater but then I realized it was a choice made for the film. Normally this would annoy me slightly, and I suppose still did, as I am a big fan of depth of field, mise–en–scènes set ups (Citizen Kane is one of my favorite films). I came to terms with the stylistic choice made for this film as it reminded me so much of Eastern influences, in this case it was reminiscent of Zen ink and brush compositions, where the sharpness lies in where the brush first touches down and the edges disappear into an almost mist like effect.\n\nWhile Keanu sold the action pieces well, he wasn\'t asked to do too much to stretch his stoic emotional range, which is just what the film required. He was pretty much perfect for this part if I had been for some reason been asked to recast this film, I would be hard pressed to find a better fit. This would have been right up Jason Statham\'s alley, however there is nothing more he could have added to it. There was something quietly instance about Reeves that made you feel that he was one not to be trifled with. Statham will always remind me of the character he played in Snatch, which was not at all overly menacing or intimidating. Rather, if I had my choice of an alternative, I would delve further into the Japanese gangster genre and extract Chow Yun-fat. Reeves was 49 in this film and still convincing as an ass kicker. Chow Yun-fat would have been ten years older, but that would have further added to the realism of a retired hit man that is unwillingly dragged back into the \'business\'.\n\nSpeaking of performances, this film was full of great character actors from the action genre and otherwise. One of these performances that I was not overly fond of was that of Alfie Allen. You probably know him as the dickless Theon Greyjoy. He worked in the part in that he was highly unlikable, however I was not sure which accent he was trying to commit to. This brings me to another flaw of the film. Many of the baddies simply did not measure up to be worthy of the John Wick challenge. A spoiled brat son of a crime boss nor the crime boss himself, an old man that the film gave no hint as to any physical prowess until the anticlimactic final battle gave any feeling that the fight would go any other direction except to a single minded John Wick killing stroke.\n\nI highly recommend this film if you are a fan of good action. This easily ranks as one of the pure action movies of 2014. Judged as just a movie, it is simple in story structure, but what it does it does very well.\n\nBlarv Score out of 10: 8.8'),(1441,85,'6/10','I Don\'t Get It','xiaoli7377','14 April 2023','I really don\'t understand the love that \"John Wick\" receives. It\'s just kind of a generic action thriller to me. No different than a \"Bourne\" or \"Taken\" movie. It gets a slight bump for me in a rating of 6 instead of 5 because I did think that the cinematography was really good and also the fight choreography was top notch. I can definitely see the influence of martial arts films on this.\n\nAs for the story, it\'s basically not there. What\'s worse is the fact that the movie goes out of its way to constantly remind you that John Wick (Keanu Reeves) as a character is someone who is incredibly lethal and dangerous and feared by criminals. In my opinion, this completely kills whatever dramatic weight the cheesy storyline that \"they killed my dog and stole my car\" plot has to begin with.\n\nI guess people liked it well enough because it\'s got three sequels and more to come. Personally I don\'t think it\'s any better than the average Netflix Original action movie. Huge skip in my opinion.'),(1442,85,'5/10','You don\'t mess with another person\'s dog. It\'s as simple as that!','Coventry','5 May 2023','With the fourth installment scoring immensely at the cinemas as I\'m submitting this review, and after three previous films that are apparently loved by everyone else in the world, I thought perhaps it would be time for me check out \"John Wick\".\n\nBut, even though I\'m late to the party as usual, I don\'t feel like I\'ve missed out on a lot. \"John Wick\" is a fast-paced and adrenaline-rushing action flick, but not the traditional type of action movie, like \"Die Hard\" or \"Lethal Weapon\". Since a good fifteen years or so, there seemingly exists an additional new sub-genre within the world of action/thriller cinema, which is best described as \"Shoot \'em Up\" films, and \"John Wick\" neatly fits into this category. Other examples include \"Shoot \'em Up\", - duh - , \"Crank\", \"Hardcore Henry\", \"Free Fire\", \"Taken\" and \"Everly\". You guessed it; - these are films with very thin plots and without any proper character development, but they primarily focus on non-stop violent action, excessively over-the-top gunfire action and a practically immeasurable body count. They are entertaining if you\'re in a completely undemanding mood, I reckon, but they are quite unmemorable as well. Moreover, despite all the action and bloodshed, these films are sort of boring, because they constantly repeat the same old \"bang-bang-you\'re-all-dead\" routine.\n\nThe most interesting aspects about \"John Wick\" are definitely the structural framework and background stories the script constantly hints at. The rudimentary plot of an invincible and stoic hitman coming out of retirement to extract vengeance of a personal nature is really old and has been told hundreds of times before. The organization in which our protagonist operates, however, is intriguing to say the least. He knows everyone, both the ones supporting him and the ones he\'s shooting up, there\'s a sort of code of conduct that includes the use of specific coins and the respect of neutral zones, the cleaning up bloody shootout aftermaths is referred to as diner reservations, and even the local law enforcer doesn\'t seem surprised when John answers the door with a bloodied face. None of these particularities ever get explained, but then again, there are at least three more films.\n\nThe sole thing to bear in mind when watching a film like \"John Wick\" remains: don\'t ask yourself any questions. Where does the never-ending supply of redundant henchmen keeps coming from? Why can\'t anyone hit a target expect for the hero? Why engage into a fistfight when there\'s a possibility for a clean shot? Why capture your target instead of killing him straight away, for that matter? You know he\'ll just escape again and kill you instead. Most importantly, why didn\'t anyone at least try to apologize to Wick for murdering his puppy?\n\nIf you seek logic and answers to these questions, \"John Wick\" is a terrible film. In case you accept what it is, there\'s entertainment aplenty thanks to the impressive stunt work, the solid performances by Keanu Reeves and the supportive cast, inventive little gimmicks, and a whole lot of mean people that get punished for making the wrong career choices in their lives.'),(1443,85,'0U','love this movie highly recommend','23 February 2020','Was this review helpful?

The fun factor this amazing action film has is probably the highest of any movie this year. I could not stop myself from having a blast!\n\nFirst and foremost, being also the first thing you notice, \"John Wick\" is self-conscious of what it is and doesn\'t, for not even one second, take itself more seriously than it should. Fortunately this doesn\'t shut out the place for character connection and empathy. People often think the two of these things exclude themselves, but that is not what I think and this movie is proof of it. It has such a genuine sense of fun and humor, so much so that you are often laughing WITH (not AT) the movie at the preposterousness of everything and at the same time feeling genuine tension for the characters you\'re rooting for. I know it sounds ridiculous, but every single f***ing kill by John Wick feels exciting and liberating, it was incredible how much I was rooting for him. To this contributes some stunning, fast-and-furious level action scenes that benefit amazingly by the practicality involved. Hats off to the director and the special effects guys for staging such a flawless string of adrenaline-pumping scenes, in particular to the director for the highly energetically stylish direction that never feels as a gimmick or out of place, yet instead makes everything all the more enjoyable. Furthermore this is one of the few movies in which sound actually stood out and contributed in making the film a great success. Keanu Reeves is perfect for the role and brings to the screen so much charisma I could not help but root for the guy. He is surrounded by a great cast too that has very fun moments on their own. If all of this wasn\'t enough, \"John Wick\" has some great original ideas and plays with them in the best way possible.\n\nDespite having a blast in the theater and wanting to maybe see this movie again in a year or so, it isn\'t original, stylish or innovative enough to say: \"we\'ve seen this plot before, but not quite done this way\". Yes it has its brilliance, but it is kind of cheesy, even if in a good way, and predictable. It doesn\'t rank up to a higher standard of action movie because of its straight-forwardness. It does have some stakes, but all in all there isn\'t really an overwhelming set piece or twist that makes it highly remarkable.\n\nObviously, that is not what it\'s aiming for and because of that I could recommend this movie to anybody, just go and have the best action entertainment fun in the theater!'),(1445,85,'10/10','Smoothest action film to come around in a long time','IceSkateUpHill','22 October 2014','John Wick is something special. It takes as much time setting up elaborate action sequences as it does the world with which it all takes place in. And what a world it is. It reminds me of Millers Crossing and it is cooler than any other recent attempt at noir. We are shown a criminal underworld where, if you are connected, many powerful people know who you are and show you respect. John Wick was connected but he got out. He is the rare killer who has found peace, and he is grateful for that peace. Some young kids steal that from him and he does what he does best, he wages a one man war against the Russian Mafia. It might sound like the film takes quite a leap but it all makes sense. The motives of John and the people who get in the way of his bullets are all very clear, even if it does come across as rather simple. That\'s the plot at it\'s most basic. Then there\'s the action. The film is directed by Reeve\'s stuntman from The Matrix, so this guy knows action. There are sequences that flow so smoothly it puts other action films and their quick cuts to shame. Keaunu moves so fluidly throughout the film and comes across as such a natural that the only disappointment is that we have not seen him like this before. Along the way are plenty of character actors, fans of The Matrix and The Wire will recognize a few people then there are more obvious ones like Ian McShane and Willem Dafoe. Everyone seems to be having a good time. That is another plus for this movie. It get\'s dark at times but overall it is quite fun, not very chipper, but fun. I cannot recommend this movie enough.

Great to watch it at home, not boring at all, if you don\'t expect something like 007 series with Daniel Craig or Born series. Keanu kept his face and body almost perfect, so he is still handsome and fit, good enough for the film like this. But the enemies have less impression.

JOHN WICK is a relentless, pulse-pounding thriller that has plenty of similarity to the Liam Neeson classic TAKEN, albeit with a more simplistic (and also more emotionally intense) plot line. This is the kind of lean, pared-down film-making that\'s all about intensity and momentum. It sits well with classic international fare like POINT BLANK, SLEEPLESS NIGHT, MEA CULPA, THE MAN FROM NOWHERE, and THE RAID films.\n\nJOHN WICK isn\'t a perfect film; some of the dialogue is sloppily, some of the writing is too broad, and occasionally the music is intrusive. However, when it gets things right, as it frequently does, you can forgive all of these minor niggles and sit back and enjoy the ride. The clever decision was made to employ a martial arts expert as director, so the emphasis is on realistic, superbly choreographed action sequences, and they\'re hard-hitting and plentiful. The nightclub set-piece is the obvious highlight, but nearly all of the action here is spectacular.\n\nKeanu Reeves has been in lots of average or overrated films over the years but this stands as one of his very best, alongside SPEED. His dry, laconic turn is light years ahead of his other recent action flick, MAN OF TAI CHI. The supporting cast is basically unnecessary, but Michael Nyqvist, Willem Dafoe, and Alfie Allen all put in decent turns. In the end, though, JOHN WICK is all about the action, and quite simply it rocks. Bring on the sequel!'),(1448,85,'7/10','Probably NOT a film to watch with your kids or mother.','planktonrules','10 September 2019','When the story begins, John (Keanu Reeves) has just lost his wife. After her death, he\'s a bit lost but tries to rebuild his life. One day, he\'s getting gas and a young Russian-American punk notices Wick\'s classic car...and tries to buy it off him. But Wick isn\'t interested and declines. Soon, the punk arrives at Wick\'s home with some goons where they surprise him--beating him senseless, destroying his stuff, killing his dog and stealing his car! This is when you then learn that Wick is a super-assassin....and the punk chose the wrong guy to attack. The jerk\'s father is a big-time Russian mobster....and it\'s a contest to see who will win...the mobster and his gang or Wick on his own. Considering there are (so far) two MORE John Wick films, it pretty much seems certain who will win this battle.\n\nTo say \"John WIck\" is a violent film is a gross undestatement. Once the dog dies, it\'s pretty much a bloodbath from then on...with Wick dispatching countless goons VERY realistically on his way to ultimate revenge. And, he doesn\'t just kill a few...he makes sure to kill them by double and triple-tapping his prey. Blood and mayhem make this a lousy film to show your kids, mother or Father O\'Reilly when he comes over for a visit!\n\nSo, aside from being a bloodbath, is it any good? Yes, it\'s an excellent all-action film...but....it IS hard to watch and is essentially a giant gore-fest. In many ways, it\'s like the Sonny Chiba \'Street Fighter\' films....that violent and that dedicated to making sure all the victims are indeed dead!

A sober grown man. With children. Children with whom I have now sat through hundreds of movies. Many of which I have enjoyed. And I am not completely hardened in my sophistication. The opening music to The Lion King brought tears to my eyes when my little ones were but wee tots. But still, these are after all just children\'s movies. In another life, I would never have seen them. And, really, one can\'t take such movies too seriously, can one?\n\nAnd so, this summer, after the ritual badgering, I dutifully trudged into yet another Disney \"adventure\" movie. Named after that tired old ride in Anaheim I first went on in 1965. I mean really, how much can you expect?\n\nAnd then, it happened. The swirling intoxication. The stunned feeling. What? Who? How? Was this a movie? Or a religious experience? Perhaps more like an addictive experience...\n\nI cannot remember ever willingly paying to see any movie not starring a relative of mine more than twice, and I can count those movies on one hand. I have now seen \"Pirates\" four times. The only thing keeping me from seeing it again is the sense that this whole thing is just getting out of hand. I cannot get enough of it. It\'s like walking into a painting that you never want to come back out of. My children ask, with a note of concern in their voices, \"Dad, you really like Pirates of the Caribbean a lot, don\'t you?\"\n\nAnd that Depp fellow. My God. I never had any idea who he was, but his name sounded like something created for a pubescent cover-boy for magazines published to hook thirteen year-old girls on make-up and bad music. Wasn\'t Depp the name of some hair-goo product back in the 60s?\n\nI am a straight male. I have several good friends who are gay, but have never fantasized about any gender but the female. But now I understand how women can experience swooning crushes on male film stars. He is simply extraordinary. So sly, so seductive, so canny! I read an interview in which Depp said he went through a slight depression when he had to stop playing Captain Jack Sparrow. I can see why. His inventiveness and sheer pleasure in inhabiting the character come through in every frame.

I find myself laughing with dizzy appreciation when Barbossa barks out, \"You\'d best be believing in ghost stories, Miss Turner, you\'re in one!\" and the grinning skeletons come into view, with Badelt\'s pounding score keeping time to the beat of their maniacal deck-swabbing. And then there\'s the scene of the pirate-ghouls slithering up from the darkened sea on the mooring cables of the Dauntless, like infernal cats stalking their prey.\n\nAnd now to the music. I can just hear the effete aesthetes dismissing this score, as Mr. Zimmerman anticipates with his winking \"overproduced by\" credit on the cover-liner. \"Bombastic.\" \"Overdone.\" \"Absurdly Stupendous.\"\n\nWell, perhaps it is, for those who spend their lives evaluating such things. To me, it is absolutely transporting. I first listened to it while doing a work-out on a rowing machine and found that I tripled my usual distance. It was like mainlining some hazardous tachycardic amphetamine.\n\nOnce again, the children were wondering, \"What\'s up with Daddy? Is he OK?\"\n\nPerhaps I am just losing my grip, having an adolescent movie get to me this way. But when those final credits roll, and Captain Jack narrows his eyes and says, \"Now, bring me that horizon. Drink up me hearties, yo ho\" and the music swells ... it is difficult to put into words the effect it has.\n\nAt this point my children have to yank me forcibly from the theater, lest I persist in watching the credits to the bitter end, and bid good-bye to the little monkey once more, wiping tears of exultation from my eyes.\n\nThis is not just another \"entry\" in the summer blockbust sweepstakes. It is an exquisite work of fantasy and inventiveness, a true classic, on the order of \"The Wizard of Oz.\" I do hope Depp\'s performance garners not just awards, but a place in the pantheon, something we old fogies -- and our gently fogeying children decades hence -- will show to our children and grandchildren like a revealed treasure.

Well, I wouldn\'t go quite that far, but there\'s no doubt whatsoever that when I lost my heart to this film, Johnny Depp\'s outrageous Cap\'n Jack Sparrow had almost everything to do with it. I don\'t normally review \'current\' films, so the very fact that I\'m writing this highlights an almost unprecedented event - after endless failures, Hollywood has finally rediscovered the spirit of the classic swashbuckler movie.\n\nWith hindsight, I think the one brilliant decision that was made at some point - given a modern production environment - was to *separate the roles* of hero and swashbuckler. You can then have your worthy Costner-type juvenile lead, as required, who has to Come To Terms with his Past (although his eventual fate is a trifle unexpected in conventional terms...) - *but* you can also have your essential and irrepressible swaggering rogue (of course, he totally steals the film from the moment he first appears, but *that\'s* no hardship!)\n\nThe moonlight special effects were overdone, in my opinion - not that they aren\'t believable, but that they would have been more effective if used more sparingly, for occasional flashes of nastiness rather than solid minutes of battle. However, that\'s a minor niggle. The stunts are energetic, highly satisfactory, *not* computerised, and on occasion even carried out by the stars :-)\n\nThe other saving grace of the production is its humour - not that there aren\'t a few over-arch knowing references, but on the whole it manages to send itself up without suspending disbelief in the process. Jack Sparrow\'s first arrival on the scene (with total aplomb aboard a steadily-sinking boat) is a prime example, as indeed are the vast majority of subsequent scenes involving this character...\n\nThe basic Romance and Rescue structure is satisfactory enough, with the addition of the requisite Feisty Female for the 21st century (though I felt the character would have been a little more historically plausible if she had been a little less liberated - she clearly possesses a stronger character than her young man, she doesn\'t have to strive to be his physical equal as well...) However, it is the pirates themselves who really make the film, simply by being a pack of unreconstructed and uninhibited villains (from the Jeffrey Farnol School of Historical Dialect) who are far larger than life and totally unselfconscious about it. To quote the opening words of the \'Guardian\' review: \"we have been waiting [50 years] for a modern pirate film featuring someone who, in all seriousness, actually says the words, or perhaps the two-syllable single word: \'Ah-harrrrr!\'\"\n\nJack Sparrow, as swashbuckler extraordinaire and consummate rogue (of course, totally honest in his own way... ahem) is the main attraction of the entire film. Not so much loopy as totally round the bend - outrageous and unpredictable (there is a running gag throughout the first part of the film where he is repeatedly described as \"the worst pirate I\'ve ever seen\", as in \"the worst at it\", only for the preposterous tactics in question to prove spectacularly successful).\n\nThis character saves the hero in more ways than one - without him, the film would be another \"Mask of Zorro\", a rather stodgy attempt to update an old favourite for modern-day sensibilities and compensate with more and flashier sword-fighting (swashbuckling is not *about* fighting! It comes into it, yes, but it\'s not the point.) But together, the pair work off one another beautifully - reliability and inspired lunacy, self-doubt and cocky flamboyance, dogged devotion and shameless self-interest. The only question is which, precisely, is the sidekick...\n\nThere are two beginnings to this film, neither of them bearing any relation to the wooden costume-drama-by-numbers prologue that actually opens the movie. The moment when events start to move (it could scarcely be less subtle) is signalled by the swell of the theme music for the first time at Sparrow\'s initial appearance. But for me the moment when the film really took off was in that instant during his first escape, when he seizes the rope and swings up, up, and out, in a classic swashbuckler move from the past that brought it all flooding back... and my heart flew up after him into my throat, and remained enjoyably in that position until the end of the movie, when the audience began spontaneously to applaud.\n\nThe film is far from perfect - characters like Captain Norrington (*please* - \'Commodore\', like \'Prime Minister\', is a job description, not a form of address!) and the Governor are little more than pantomime stereotypes, with only frustrating hints of humanity to indicate that they do after all have potential denied them by the script. Annoying anachronisms slip in - \"it\'s okay\", \"I was rooting for you\" - most of the nautical jargon comes out with about as much sign of comprehension as a phonetic rendition of a foreign language, and Sparrow\'s one precious charge of powder gets soaked through often enough in the course of the plot to be utterly useless by the end. Both hero and heroine come across as wooden and thankless roles. Orlando Bloom may be costumed to look increasingly like Errol Flynn during the course of the film (was it my imagination, or does he spend it gradually cultivating a duplicate of that famous moustache?), but, alas, any resemblance ends there.\n\nBut then it doesn\'t really matter. It is Depp, not Bloom, who has inherited the mantle of Flynn and Fairbanks in this film. Jack Sparrow was the character who caught my imagination - and, since I\'m extremely impressionable, also had a distinctly peculiar effect on the way I stood and walked for several hours later. And there\'s not many films can say *that*..! ÿ'),(1467,86,'7/10','memorable Johnny Depp','SnoopyStyle','12 October 2015','Governor Weatherby Swann (Jonathan Pryce), his daughter Elizabeth and Lieutenant James Norrington (Jack Davenport) rescue boy Will Turner from a burning wreck on their way to Port Royal.

Eight years later, Governor Swann is trying to set up Elizabeth (Keira Knightley) with the fast rising Norrington but she is still taken with Will (Orlando Bloom), now a swordsmith. Captain Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) rescues Elizabeth from the water but he is set to hang for being a pirate. He escapes but Will helps catch him. Meanwhile the gold pirate medallion has called in Captain Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush) on the haunted Black Pearl to attack the port. Barbossa kidnaps Elizabeth with the medallion.

My major qualm with the film is that it was way too long, this could have been cut down to a 90 minute non-stop adventure movie. But instead it gets a little repetitive and unnecessary at times (fighting the undead?).\n\nThe second major annoyance was that the fight scenes were shot too close. The cinematography was very fast paced and close up (remember Moulin Rouge?), there are really no long drawn out panoramic shots here. This may seem trivial, but I had trouble following the action, it seemed very rushed and inconsistent.\n\nThe acting was pretty good, given the fairly straightforward, cut and paste adventure movie script. With the exception of Depp\'s eccentricity, the dialogue is mainly to advance the plot instead of develop any interesting characters. Geoffrey Rush overacts as normal but is an entertaining villain. Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightley are at times a bit stale, but otherwise do a decent job with the material.\n\nOverall, Depp is entertaining, and good swashbuckling action is rare these days.

They will have to confront a nasty villain (Geoffrey Rush) and his henchmen\n\nThe motion picture mingles adventures , action-packed , thrills , humor with tongue-in-cheek , rip-roaring , romance and results to be bemusing enough . Yet another swahbuckler adventure in which our starring blacksmith Will Turner teams up with eccentric pirate \"Captain\" Jack Sparrow to save his love by embarking in a maritime escapade and these protagonists will have to confront an ominous villain and his hoodlums who are now undead. The film runtime is overlong : two hours and some , but is neither boring , nor tiring but entertaining. The movie there is a homage to the pirates\' films , paying tribute to classic pirate movies , also to Ray Harryhausen and his picture ¨Jason and the Argonauts¨ regarding the living skeletons . The action is messy and repetitive and there\'s a slew of duels and betrayals . As part of a franchise based on a theme park ride , this installment lives up to its heritage ordinary bouts of heart-pumping espectacle including merciless pursuits , fantastic pirates , living skeletons , ships tumble down, overwhelming duels , swashbuckling and anything else . As usual , Johnny Depp is the real star , he invests this overfed , action-tractioned swashbuckler with a voluptuous wit and fantasy enough . First-rate interpretation by Johnny Depp , he plays Sparrow as a purring East End dandy and like Robert Newton in the film titled \'Blackbeard\', providing the necessary hilarious touches . Along with habitual roles : Depp , Orlando Bloom , Kiera Knightley who was only eighteen years old when this movie came out , they\'re well accompanied by a good support cast , such as :Jack Davenport, Jonathan Pryce, Lee Arenberg, Kevin MacNally , Mackenzie Crook , Martin Klebba, Greg Ellis, Damian O\'Hare , Isaac C.

If it wasn\'t for this movie, Johnny Depp wouldn\'t be as famous as he is today. Every scene with him or Geoffery Rush is brilliant. The movie is very crisp and the shots of the islands are breathtaking. Definitely a movie worth picking up at Blockbuster or even better, buying ( I don\'t buy DVDs often but this was one of them). The characters are thought out very well and plot is excellent. The script is one of the main stars of the film itself, every line that seems to come out of Sparrow or Barbossa\'s mouth or any of the other cast is original. If you like action films you\'ll love this, if you like comedy you\'ll love this, actually, this movie is great for everyone (except small kids, who may get frightened by the skeleton scenes). 10/10\n189 out of 244 found this helpful.

It was a quick easy read. There was obvious inspiration from various other futuristic young adult books I have read, like \"The Giver\", \"Ender\'s Game\" and the \"Hunger Games\" books. Like the others, the treatment of the story was cold, But its descriptions of the initiation rites were very much more violent.\n\nThe setting is the walled city of Chicago after a great war. Their society is divided into five distinct Factions based on personality traits: Dauntless (brave), Amity (friendly), Candor (honest), Erudite (intelligent) and Abnegation (selfless).\n\nAt the age of 16, a child takes an examination to help him choose which one will be his faction for the rest of his life. He may follow the suggestion of the exam results, or he may decide on his own. Those who fail to be accepted into a faction becomes factionless, as they become hopelessly poor and destitute for life.\n\nOur heroine Beatrice Prior has been born to the Abnegation faction with their grey clothes and disdain for any form of vanity. However, her examination results are revealed to be inconclusive, so she has to make her own decision. Meanwhile, an uprising is brewing in Erudite against the government run by Abnegation.\n\nI had some problem with the book and the way they try to make the Factions distinct from each other, when it is easy to see that overlapping does happen. These traits simply cannot be mutually exclusive from each other. It is also disturbing the way the author describes the Dauntless. Does being brave mean jumping off running trains, having piercings and tattoos, beating each other up mercilessly, or even killing yourself? This may give immature readers the wrong ideas about courage.\n\n\n\nThe film was a perfectly conceived interpretation of the book. In the first few scenes where they show the color-coded clothes distinguishing each faction was quite clear. How director Neil Burger showed us most of the memorable scenes in the book, like the choosing ceremony, the jumping on and off the trains, the fear landscapes of Tris and Four, and the invasion of Abnegation were all very well done.\n\nThere were some parts which were reinterpreted in the film. Most did not really affect the story-telling, like changing how Tris meets her Mom during Visiting Day, or glossing over a particularly violent episode where Peter stabs a fellow initiate in the eye. There was one big change towards the end about how a climactic surprise rescue transpired. I thought the version in the book was so much more better set-up and executed than the less-dramatic altered version we saw on screen.\n\nAs I suspected, the tall and beautiful Shailene Woodley is definitely not the small and mousy Tris we imagine while reading the book. However, I thought Shailene gave an excellent portrayal of Tris\' character, how she developed from a shy dependent girl to a confident fearless warrior. For people who have not read the books, they will not be aware of any discrepancy at all.\n\nTheo James had very good romantic chemistry with Shailene, so his Four never really felt like a threat to Tris, unlike the initial parts in the book. The director gave James a lot of lingering close-ups for the benefit of the teenage fan girls.\n\nAnsel Elgort, who played Tommy Ross in \"Carrie\" recently, now plays Tris\' brother Caleb. His Caleb is less dynamic than I imagined him in the book. Coincidentally, Elgort has an upcoming movie with Shailene Woodley later this year called \"The Fault in Our Stars\" where they play boyfriend-girlfriend.\n\nMore up and coming actors play other more minor characters. Zoe Kravitz, who was in \"After Earth\" last year, is not exactly how I envisioned Tris\' best friend, but she won me over as the film went along. Miles Teller, who was recently in \"That Awkward Moment\", plays bad boy Peter, whose role in the film is much diminished compared to the book. Jai Courtney, who played Bruce Willis\' son in \"A Good Day to Die Hard\" last year, brutally plays Tris\' tormentor in the training camp.\n\nAmong the senior stars, Ashley Judd makes a nice comeback of sorts playing Tris\' mother, who had major secrets of her own. Maggie Q played Tris\' examiner and tattoo artist Tori with the requisite compassion. Kate Winslet plays the cool and calculating Erudite uprising leader Jeanine with icy perfection.\n\nOverall, I thought this film was a practically perfect interpretation of a book that was less than perfect in itself. So, whatever things the film might show us which we might not like, like the slow pace of action progression, and the questionable motives of the characters, are actually because the book told it that way. Fans of the \"Divergent\" books will find this film version faithful. While it cannot compare to the high standard set by the Hunger Games film series in terms of cinematic quality and character casting, \"Divergent\" definitely has its own entertaining appeal going for it. 7/10.'),(1474,87,'8/10','\"Don\'t Try And Define Me.\"','TheAnimalMother','8 September 2014','I have to say that the producers would have to be stupid not to use Burger again as the director. He did such a great job with this one. I thought I was going to see a film that was mostly aimed at teens. However the story alone makes this far superior to most teen oriented films. In fact this didn\'t feel much like a teen film at all. The fantasy story is a great metaphor for our current society, it\'s simply a very relevant film. The directing here was spot on. The story as fun as it is, does have a few holes, sure, but they are easy to look over because they are such small holes. The film simply works as a commentary piece on political philosophy, and as an entertaining action film laced with some romantic tension. In my view this film was far, far superior to the very teen oriented and very one dimensional Hunger Games, and it\'s certainly more unique as well. Woodley is impressive here, clearly showing the ability to play a very layered and complex character.\n\n8/10\n50 out of 74 found this helpful. Was this review helpful?

Set in a near-future Chicago, what we see is another take on the dystopian society. The central plot here is that growing up in this walled in world, everyone must fit into one of five classes. But of course, the question here is what if you don\'t fit into the nicely packaged definition of a single class, then you must be Divergent, or in this movie, a danger to the perfect society. When our main character, Tris (played very well by Shailene Woodley)finds out she is Divergent she must hide this secret and discover the reasons why it is such a secret and why society fears Divergents. I\'ll leave all of that for you to watch unfold in the various physical and psychological training exercises that are portrayed on screen. In a nutshell, the world painted is similar to that of Equilibrium but with much less action. This is not a bad thing, since this allows the cinematographer to reveal a very wonderfully crafted view of this world. The pacing of this movie moves along nicely as we plod through Tris trying to fit in as a part of the Dauntless clan. Friendships are made, lost, and so on as expected. Even more so is the romantic involvement with the mysterious Four (or 4) played by Theo James (which I believe over acted his part entirely too much). So the mystery of why the government wants to kill all Divergents must be unraveled and this leads to the majority of the story. I was happy with just sitting back and enjoying the view during many of the scenes that were almost breathtaking. Not reading the book, I hope that the movie did well to portray the story but I also know it is a trilogy so they couldn\'t go from start to finish all at once. Stand alone I believe the movie was quite well made and under-appreciated, swept under the rug by the highly successful Hunger Games series. You will be hard pressed not to see the similarities between them. I am looking forward to seeing what else this world has in store for us and would recommend that moviegoers join me to find out. Will you see silly acted parts, and scenes that are just there to draw you in with nice landscapes and perfectly choreographed music, YES. But why would anyone complain about something like that? I know I wouldn\'t. Enjoy this film, you won\'t regret the time you spent on it.'),(1476,87,'6/10','Watchable if odd and slightly confusing for newbies. For fans, it\'s a good adaptation of a problematic novel - so good that it suffers from many of the book\'s flaws.','shawneofthedead','19 March 2014','When beloved books make their way to the silver screen, the resulting movies are usually met with much frustration and rending of clothes from amongst the literary faithful. A character is changed beyond recognition; a crucial plot-point excised; an important theme lost in the murk and swell of a film. Oddly, Divergent isn\'t actually a bad adaptation. In fact, Neil Burger\'s film is as good a version of Veronica Roth\'s wildly patchy source novel as you\'re likely to get. Whether that makes for a good movie - especially for people who\'ve never read the book - is another matter entirely.\n\nDivergent begins in a post-apocalyptic Chicago divided into five factions, each valuing one virtue - Dauntless (courage), Erudite (wisdom), Candour (honesty), Amity (kindness), and Abnegation (self-sacrifice) - above all others. It\'s an odd system, perhaps, but one that is apparently necessary to keep chaos at bay. Tris Prior (Shailene Woodley) has been raised in Abnegation but, try as she might, she cannot completely subsume her self or her desires. Indeed, the aptitude test that everyone must take at the age of sixteen suggests that Tris doesn\'t belong in just one category: she is Divergent, equally at home in three factions.\n\nCome the day of the Choosing Ceremony, she decides to forsake her family to become Dauntless: a decision that plunges her into a nightmare initiation process in which the weakest are summarily kicked out of the faction. As Tris navigates the politics and perils of her chosen world, trying all the while to hide the fact that she\'s Divergent, she encounters her fair share of allies - Christina (Zoe Kravitz), Will (Ben Lloyd-Hughes) and possibly her charmingly broody instructor Four (Theo James) - and enemies, including the brutal Eric (Jai Courtney) and vicious Peter (Miles Teller).\n\nAnyone unfamiliar with Roth\'s book might find themselves trying to puzzle through this seemingly shapeless mess of a plot. It ebbs and flows in odd directions, dancing around Tris\' desire to be true to herself, before it gets a little lost in the dystopian clutches of Jeanine Matthews (a gleefully icy, evil Kate Winslet), an Erudite leader hellbent on bringing down the entire Abnegation faction. Along the way, Tris literally battles her fears under the influence of a simulation serum, toughens up physically, strikes up a sexy chemistry with Four and frets over her brother Caleb (Ansel Elgort). Within the confines of this universe, it makes an odd kind of narrative sense, but the logic of it all never really bleeds through.\n\nHere\'s the thing, though: this strange, frequently illogical plotting is very much a defining characteristic of Roth\'s novel - and, in fact, becomes more of a problem as the trilogy progresses. (Anyone who\'s read Allegiant, the controversial final novel in the series, will know just how difficult it will be to adapt.) The emotional and logical flaws present in Divergent the film, then, are - for the most part - already inherent in the book. Why does Jeanine, supposedly one of the smartest people in the community, plot and plan the way she does? How does the entire society function in this utterly dysfunctional way? Technically, Burger can\'t really be faulted for failing to develop a coherence and logic that was never there in the first place.\n\nIn fact, Burger actually substantially improves upon the novel in several ways - he keeps the film mostly free of Tris\' inner voice, which becomes increasingly moony and silly as her crush on Four grows by the day. Burger plays up a zip-line sequence that highlights the joyful recklessness of the Dauntless, as Tris soars freely through the midnight air. He also handles the problem of Tris\' fear landscape very well: instead of simply willing herself out of the influence of the serum (as the Divergent can do), she must figure out how to face each of her fears in a non-Divergent way. These scenes are shot with quick, simple visual flair, dispensing with some of the novel\'s trickier convolutions.\n\nOf course, Divergent isn\'t a perfect adaptation either. To Roth\'s credit, there are some truly dark, painful moments in the novel which transcend its loopy narrative. It\'s no surprise, and yet it\'s a little disappointing, that these bits simply vanish from the film, no doubt in the interests of securing a PG-13 rating. As a result, Peter is a far less repulsive antagonist than he is on paper. For instance, he doesn\'t brutally (and casually) maul a fellow initiate who\'s doing better than him in the rankings - an incident that\'s crucial in the development of his character in the subsequent novels.\n\nThe young cast works hard and quite well together. Woodley makes for an intriguing screen presence, effectively playing both the steel and softness of Tris\' choices. James, heretofore best known for dying in Lady Mary\'s bed in Downton Abbey, acquits himself reasonably well - he\'s not as leaden as some of the trailers have suggested, and he forges a believable chemistry with Woodley. Of the supporting players, Teller is the standout, so good in his easy malevolence that he actually makes the thought of Allegiant as a movie quite appealing.\n\nIn the final analysis, Divergent is likely to divide audiences. Fans of Roth\'s books should be, on the whole, pleased. This is a frequently very good, intelligent adaptation of a rather problematic novel. Everyone else, however, might be less enamoured of the final product: a film that, just like the book on which it is based, boasts a compelling story and some great ideas, but is also messily executed, overly complicated and a tad nonsensical.'),(1477,87,'8/10','From a viewer who went to this simply to accompany his girlfriend...','cltyler1','20 March 2014','Divergent is gripping and intelligently brought to life on the big screen from the director who brought us \"Limitless\" and \"The Illusionist.\" Are we seeing something of similar essence with the \"Hunger Games\" series? Yes. However, my personal take was that the characters were more engaging and the plot was as well in this film. Shailene is excellent at the helm, and really brings forth a convincing portrayal of a heroine battling in a world where chaos and tragedy envelope the characters. Her graceful emergence from shy personality to dominance is done artfully and really speaks to her ability as an actress. Theo James is also exceptional in the co-pilot role and almost effortlessly seems to pull off the bad boy with standards persona in a manner I haven\'t seen since Will Smith in his prime. The plot is high octane and especially more gritty than I first imagined. The emotion raw in intensity and empathic build. As a guy who was just going to this film to act as arm candy and a shoulder to lean on for my highly enthused girlfriend, I can write this piece while honestly saying that my eyes were glued to the screen the entirety of the film and was pleased to see this film do such an excellent job at developing both the plot and characters involved in it.

Unfortunately Tris cannot be a part to any of these factions because she is a divergent. Divergents are considered as the most important and dangerous people and have to be eliminated but why?\n\nI liked this movie because it has a different kind of plot from other Sci-Fi movies and that\'s something that made this movie interesting at first. The direction which made by Neil Burger was very good with many good action scenes. Also the interpretation of Shailene Woodley who played as Tris was very good. An equally good interpretation made by Theo James who played as Four.\n\nFinally I have to admit that I did not expect much from \"Divergent\" but it was a very nice surprise. This movie made a very good start for this trilogy and I hope to continue like this and even better.'),(1479,87,'9/10','Best tween film in ages','MovieSonic','29 July 2014','I\'m glad I got around to watching this, I\'m not sure who\'s writing the negative reviews or what they were expecting but I can honestly say that this is the best tween film I\'ve seen in a long time.\n\nIt IS a tween film, it\'s blatantly aimed at young girls and as a \"twenty-something\" youngish female, I\'m not embarrassed to say that I really enjoyed this film. It\'s pure fantasy fodder of course but here\'s what I liked about it:\n\nthe relationship between the two leads develops naturally i.e. they don\'t see each other and go \'you\'re my soulmate\', in fact they don\'t really get on at first so this is believable and refreshing\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI have now watched this film about 4 or 5 times because I really liked so much of it: the fighting was believable for me because I think we\'ve all gotten used to flashy choreography and sound effects but that\'s not what real fights look like or how they sound so for me, these fight scenes are really good. I liked the weapons because they kept it simple and for training, they\'re a good idea.\n\nProbably the thing I liked the most is the fact that \"it\'s not all about Tris\". I mean, it IS all about Tris but it\'s not \'totally in your face, the world revolves around Tris and no-one else matters\' all about Tris... What I mean is that there are some \"films\" out there which spend their entire running time having the supporting actors running around warning the lead actress not to have sex with her boyfriend lest he destroy her vagina but in this film, the lead actress often shares centre stage with her new best friend, there are a lot of scenes where she is in the background looking out as opposed to a lot of shots of her standing alone / in the centre and we see her friend fighting too; the focus is just not \'always\' on her. Having said that, I do think that there could have been even \'more\' focus on the people around her. First of all, had we gotten to know her friends better, we might have empathised with them more (trying not to include spoilers!) and also, this will sound harsh but it needs saying, I\'m sick of seeing \'ethnic\' people in minor or reduced roles: what a waste of Mekhi Phifer! I wish that Zoë Kravitz had been given more to do, yes she had a decent amount of screen time but I would have liked to maybe see her \'fearscape\' and... that\'s about it for ethnic characters I think... yep.\n\nI liked that Jai Courtney\'s character didn\'t go overboard as the villain but again, his character was a little one dimensional and I would have liked to have seen some more interaction and dialogue between him and Four just to flesh out their background story.\n\nKate Winslet honestly did the best she could with her part and it\'s a massive credit to her that she managed to make me severely dislike her and believe that she was evil with just a few odd lines here and there. Her role is to literally just pop into the film every now and then to be a bit menacing and give off a female-Hitler vibe (bright blonde hair). But she pulls it off in my opinion. There\'s no point in elaborating on why someone is pure evil, we know this exists, it\'s happened in the real world and it\'s still happening so her role didn\'t distract from the believability of the story.\n\nOverall, I liked the subtlety of the story. There is no sex, no profanity, no overt \'I love yous\' yet it didn\'t come across as \'after-school-specially\' at all. Also, I never groaned out loud once or cringed or had to hide my face behind a pillow while someone professed their undying love for someone they just met a week ago. The dialogue was realistic with occasional over-rehearsed acting from some of the supporting cast but I really loved this film. Go into it knowing it\'s a tween film and that there won\'t be a lot of intelligent scientific explanations for things and you\'ll probably enjoy it as much as I did.\n\n9/10'),(1480,87,'7/10','DIVERGENT may have just saved young adult adaptations in Hollywood.','Spazplayer20','21 March 2014','DIVERGENT delivers where so many of the recent young adult novel film adaptations have failed. I saw this film not having read the book and on its own it stands very well.\n\nFirst off the bad:\n\n1) action sequences feel slow and not natural. You can tell that the actors were not particularly familiar with hand to hand combat, not to say their characters weren\'t supposed to be but even when they\'re supposed to know how to fight it feels lackluster. 2) obvious age difference between the two main characters. 3) high school Clich feel for the first half of the film.\n\nNow with that said ^ here is what Worked:\n\n1) length. Often we see film adaptations of novels try and cram everything into 90 or 100 mins but Divergent takes its time. Normally this would be a drawback but the film makes good use of the extra time (the film is 145 mins) to really progress. 2) the performances of the main characters are solid. Nothing amazing but the dynamic between the two main characters works well. - the visual style of the film is very good. The dystopian city of Chicago is very well realized. 3) brings to light moral and societal problems. Suprizingly deep for a young adult film.\n\nOVERALL divergent is a good film. It fails in few places but succeeds in most that count. With the failure of young adult movies such as Percy Jackson, Divergent healthily separates itself from them. I would recommend seeing it. There WILL be a sequel.'),(1481,87,'10/10','Refreshing.','september_90','29 October 2014','My review is not based on reading the book but solely on the movie alone.

It had me on the edge of my seat for most of the movie. This movie is inspiring and motivational. It is the type of movie that shows that accepting people for the flaws and their strengths is important and that everyone is different in their own way and that it\'s okay to be who you are. I think more kids need to see these types of movies and I would recommend it to anyone. P.S.

Unfortunately it looks like Hollywood makes movies for people with short memory. I admit I haven\'t read the source book, but I guess I wouldn\'t, judging by what came out of it. I hereby venture myself in saying that the book is also a bad SciFi novel. It has way to obvious imports from well known themes that have been exploited to the brim by today (like the \"perfect\" society that sacrifices diversity for peace, the \"different\" guy that stands-up to the system, the genuine technology that controls individuals (poorly described, by the way), the fear confrontation ad the list could go on and on. It is not essentially bad to bring these themes in a movie, but I see nothing new, original here. So... if you have seen Equilibrum and the Hunger Games then you know it all. Movies today are just mobile phones... keep reproducing \"features\" from the competition, while it is supposed to be an art. Another thing can\'t stand in movies in general is the poor IT incursions. I am talking about the scene in which Jeanine is asked to turn off the \"control system\" which consists of a huge touch screen in which she just hits some \"cancel\" button. That was really pathetic... Anyone could have done that right? Another thing that I can\'t stand, is the cheap psychology things in these movies. They are all based on some sort of psychoanalysis which is long time deprecated in therapy. But it is somehow considered to be \"cool\" and \"trendy\" by producers to insert these kind of flavour into the movies to make it more profound. Or are they just as stupid and ignorants as the target viewers? Anyhow... to me, this is bad taste in art. If you want to really go for it, you must do way better that that and if you can\'t, then at least make it more interesting. It is also true that movies like \"Inception\" don\'t occur every month, but once they do... they set a trend and everybody will just take a byte of it. Don\'t get me wrong, it is a \"watchable\" movie, perhaps a little too long for its story, which, by the way, is very predictable and full of clichés. I read some users claiming it resembles \"The Hunger Games\" and so it is, especially with the modest ending that awkwardly announces a sequel. I could predict how the story developed and ended after the first 15 minutes and that\'s what makes this movie mediocre. Script is mediocre, but at least it does not abounds in stereotypes so it\'s bearable. What can be said about acting... there is no acting in this kind of movies, you only need to be young and good looking, be able to learn your part and you\'re done. It\'s not that the actors are bad, but the movie itself is not based on any acting mastery and just because of that, the girl gets a plus for making something out of it. I am curious if the ratings will stay as high as now in time.'),(1484,87,'7/10','Not Excellent, but Great!','gumperman','25 March 2014','When first hearing of this film and seeing the first trailer, I didn\'t know what to think about it. It didn\'t excitement me much and all the way up to it\'s release, I didn\'t feel it had that same kind of vibe that \'The Hunger Games\' had. A vibe that it was a must see film. Then I heard a sample track from the score, composed by Junkie XL. It was great, and it made me want to see the movie a little bit. Well that and I wanted to see if it was actually a great film, like The Hunger Games was. Plus I do like the main star, Shailene Woodley. Well, I just saw it today and here is what I think. The music is great, it has one of those themes that I can\'t get out of my head and a score I\'ve been listening to since I left the theater. The film itself was a very interesting film, very different from what I understood from the trailer, but I\'m not familiar with the story so that is probably the main reason. I really liked the futuristic, post-apocalyptic, dystopian feel that it had going on through it, but it also was kind of scary to think that human life could become that one day. The plot was easy enough to follow, but sometimes confusing. Though, if I had read the book, I\'m sure I would understand it 100%. The elements I had trouble remembering were the names of all the factions that people were divided in, or chose to be in, and what those factions\' meanings were. When they would show the symbols for each faction, it made sense to me, but the names itself I couldn\'t quite grasp. I\'m sure a second viewing will clear that up, defiantly if that second viewing is on blu-ray and with the captions on. Anyway, other than that, It kept me quite intrigued in a pleasantly unexpected way and I really look forward to next year for the sequel, Insurgent, and the year after that for the concluding film, Allegiant.'),(1485,87,'9/10','Exceed Expectations','une_paquerette_cache','21 March 2014','I watched the movie without having read any of the series, and yet, it is apparent that the movie did the books justice. I absolutely like how there is less romance and more substance this movie has compared to other similarly themed movies. The casting crew did a great job by choosing the lead actor and actress. The depth of the characters development is proper. Thus, this movie is also entertaining for adults. I sense good chemistry among the casts. The lead actress successfully portrays a confused yet brave teenager and captures innocence, while the lead actor renders a mature vibe that help save the movie from being categorized as another superficial teenage love story.\n103 out of 194 found this helpful.

So the cheesy plot, the seemingly nonexistent background, everything was already inherent to Divergent in my mind. To me, it was simply part of the concept that the movie would develop, so I didn\'t find it so horrible. In fact, I even thought it was a good adaptation of the book, but then that could have been because I read it over a year (or maybe even a couple of years) ago. I can\'t say it was objectively good, though.\n\nThe romance was awful, there seemed to be no chemistry between the characters in question, they definitely would have been better off as friends. Time seemed to be off too. I mean, I knew quite some time was supposed to have passed between (SPOILER)the choosing ceremony and the final confrontation(/SPOILER), but the director didn\'t seem to be able to convey the passage of time properly, so hadn\'t I read the book, I think I\'d probably have a sense of timelessness and would see it all as a bunch of things that happened somewhere at some point with some unknown amount of time separating them.\n\nNot only weren\'t characters really unique or remarkable, but also the film lacked emotion and thrill. Most scenes that could have been intense seemed to be left unexplored in detriment of more fight scenes and, seeing as I\'m not really a fan of action (or romance, for that matter), I didn\'t care much about all that violence.\n\nDespite all that, I did enjoy myself while watching it. I don\'t know why. Maybe seeing images I\'d only had in my mind be put into something real and concrete made it special to me, maybe I already knew how bad it could be, so whatever good thing came of it was surprising enough...

In fact, two sequels followed, and the first of these is \"Mad Max 2: The Road Warrior\".\n\nReleased in the U.S. simply as \"The Road Warrior\", \"Mad Max 2\" begins with a narration re-introducing us to wandering ex-cop Max (Gibson) ... and then we\'re off. In post-apocalyptic Australia, Max wanders the nuclear waste lands in search of Earth\'s most precious resource: gasoline. When he discovers a band of people guarding a large deposit of fuel, he lends his services as a driver to help them escape from a vicious group of bandits intent on taking the gas for themselves.\n\n\"Mad Max 2\" is one of the best sequels ever. It\'s everything the original was and more. Mel Gibson is great, and the cast performs very well. Brian May\'s skills as a composer have improved, and he gives a very fast-paced score. George Miller\'s directing skills have also improved, and he deals us out some intense car sequences that have yet to be rivaled.\n\nThis film is special because, although it was very popular when released and is even more popular now, it is unique in that it is not afraid to be just that. If that confused you, let me put it this way: George Miller has created a film that, while trying to improve the flaws from past films, is not afraid to be original and un-Hollywood. And I must say, Mr. Miller pulls it off excellently.\n\nI love \"The Road Warrior\" as well as the rest of the \"Mad Max\" series. I would say that \"Mad Max 2\" is quite possibly the greatest film to come out of Australia.

The film is the second installment in the Mad Max film series, with Mel Gibson starring as Max Rockatansky.\n\nI grew up with the Mad Max films and Mad Max 2: The Road Warrior Is my personal favorite best epic Post-Apocalyptic Action Classic Science Fiction film. I always loved The Road Warrior to death this film stayed in my heart. Fury Road and The Road Warrior are Equal for me so I am ranting them 10 and I always tried to take the first film of the Max series as the best one in the franchise but I couldn\'t, because it is just too dark is not post apocalyptic film enough, it has Drama between the film and the plot starts slow which becomes really boring. The Road Warrior is the opposite of Mad Max which just stayed in my heart and I just love this movie to death and I always will. Mad Max 2: The Road Warrior still remains one of the most exhilarating action films to ever grace the screen. The car chases are as excitingly pulse-pounding as ever and no film has yet to surpass the final chase as the best in movie history. Yes, in terms of pure action, not many films have been able to equal The Road Warrior\'s thrills.\n\nMel Gibson remains the only world-renowned actor in the whole film. He does a terrific job as the character Max, one of his best and most interesting characters. The development of Max is another intriguing component of The Road Warrior, and serves the film by giving it a human edge by featuring Max\'s slow transformation from loner to savior. Not only that, Gibson also creates a great action hero. There\'s not a moment in the film when we aren\'t rooting for Max to smash Humungus and his gang.The Humungus and Wez for me were the best villains ever in the film. Bruce Spence as the gyro-pilot is decent in his role and offers the film\'s few humorous moments. And also he has a lot of scenes and a lot of things to do in this film. Like flying that flayer helping Max saving him, fighting against Humungus thugs. Emil Minty as The Feral Kid is awesome. The old man as the narrator from the beginning of the film is The Feral Kid, I love the relationship between him and Max. That\'s what I love in this film the acting is TERRIFIC from the actors. Virginia Hey as Warrior Woman is beautiful and fantastic in this movie. I seriously loved how she acted towards Max that he isn\'t trust worthy, he needed to win her trust. I love Max\'s dog he was so better than in the first movie the other dog was. You could even see a personality in this dog.\n\nI love this movie to death and will always be in my heart Forever.

Gas has become a battling ground for a vicious gang but Max finds out about a location where a group of survivors have been able to produce it. The only problem is transporting it, which Max agrees to help with in exchange for enough to get him to his next location.\n\nMAD MAX 2 is a very rare sequel that actually manages to be better than the original film. This here really doesn\'t happen too often but director George Miller takes everything that made the original so good and adds a ton of adrenaline to the action and makes for quite a memorable movie. Fans of the original film are going to be happy that the rawness also gets carried over here but with even more wicked stunts and more action, it\'s impossible not to fall for this film.\n\nWhat makes it so memorable are the incredible action scenes. As with the first film, you can\'t help but watch them with your jaw on the floor as you wonder how no one was killed during the production. These action scenes aren\'t made through editing but instead they\'re just downright dirty and dangerous stunts that are incredible to watch in full speed. I\'m not going to ruin the most memorable stunts but the finale is just one miraculous scene after another as Max goes speeding down a road in a semi followed by countless bad guys. The amount of destruction on display is enough to please any action fan. It\'s these scenes here that make this movie a classic and one of the best action films of its era.\n\nWe\'re also given a great supporting cast with everyone fitting their roles quite nicely. Of course, the main star is Gibson who manages to be even better here than he was in the first film. He isn\'t given too much dialogue but he manages to really come across in a believable fashion as this drifter who once again finds himself with nothing and a reason to fight. Everything else from the wonderful score to the terrific cinematography just takes the material and raises it to new levels. MAD MAX 2 is a pure adrenaline rush from start to finish and with the borrowed elements of YOJIMBO, one can\'t help but be entertained.'),(1493,88,'10/10','on the Road Again with Mad Max and his Dog','Bogmeister','6 August 2005','But most of all, I remember the Road Warrior. By this time, many people have forgotten that this set the standard for kinetic action on the roadways. The memories fade as the years go by, new action films are released, such as \"Speed\"(94), which seem to set new standards. But, it\'s not really the case. The Road Warrior has yet to be bested, and no amount of money, computer technology or loud noises will ever accomplish the deed. Nothing will ever capture the apocalyptic intensity or, most of all, the sheer elegance of combat on the roads, as depicted here. \"Raiders of the Lost Ark\"(81), for example, captured a more frenetic goofy-style action, also relentless, but not with the level of tension. It\'s exciting, sure, but it doesn\'t tie your stomach up in knots, leaving you drained yet begging for more.\n\nThe sequel to \"Mad Max\"(79) - also a unique, tense experience - begins with an unusual prologue, giving the viewers a historical background on only half the screen. We are set up for a bombastic adventure, created as a new mythology for our perusal. Iconic figures abound, beginning with Max (Gibson) himself, of course. Here is the quintessential wandering loner hero/cowboy/samurai: he is striking - damaged both physically & mentally - but an ultimate survivor. Here are his foes: a scarred, massively-muscled atomic-age conqueror and his dogs, garbed in battle-dress for instant death and destruction. Here is his conscience: the last vestiges of civilization grouped in a makeshift fort for a final gasp of decency. When these three factions clash, it\'s the end of the world as we know it. Welcome to the new world of The Road Warrior.\n\nThe Road Warrior influenced the sub-genre of post-holocaust science fiction throughout the eighties. There were numerous imitators, mostly low-budget efforts, and none of them came close to succeeding at this level. I hope not too many people continue to forget where it all began for this thrilling corner of the sci-fi adventure genre. It is to our downfall and regret that we forget.'),(1494,88,'10/10','Exhilarating action thriller.','jiangliqings','1 March 2001','*** 1/2 out of ****\n\nAfter so many years The Road Warrior still remains one of the most exhilarating action films to ever grace the screen. The car chases are as excitingly pulse-pounding as ever and no film has yet to surpass the final chase as the best in movie history. Yes, in terms of pure action, not many films have been able to equal The Road Warrior\'s thrills.\n\nThe film takes place presumably years after the conclusion of Mad Max. The world has been devastated by a third world war and has suffered a setback by he rarity of gasoline. The loner, Max Rockatansky (Mel Gibson) is still wandering around the Australian wasteland, thousands of miles from civilization, in search of gasoline. He comes across a gyro-pilot (Bruce Spence), who tells him of a compound that\'s producing fuel.\n\nMax brings the pilot along with him and studies the compound from atop a cliff. It seems a large gang also wants the gasoline and has been besieging the refinery for a long time now. They are a pack of madmen, led by the Humungus, a hugely muscular man who wears a hockey mask to cover his face. An attempt is made by the people inside the compound to find a rig large enough to haul the fuel but the effort is brought down when Humungus\' men take down all the cars.\n\nMax, finding a perfect moment to strike a bargain, makes a deal with one of the survivors and makes it to the compound. Eventually, he makes another deal there, as he tells the people inside that in return for as much gasoline as he can carry, he\'ll bring the rig to them. What follows is classic edge-of-the-seat action entertainment.\n\nHaving inspired dozens of rip-offs, The Road Warrior still remains the best of the bunch due to the great lead performance from Mel Gibson and the unrivalled car chases, which are very much worth mentioning. The movie begins with a rousing commentary over the events that led to the destruction of government. What follows next is a short and exciting car chase. True, the following half-hour does move by a bit slowly, but it all builds up to a lightning paced final 45 minutes.\n\nThe final chase, in particular, is an exercise in action craftsmanship. Director George Miller has staged one of the most brilliant and downright exciting action scenes ever. So many spectacular stunts and on-road carnage occur during this sequence, to describe it simply wouldn\'t do it justice.\n\nMiller\'s cinematography is decidedly Un-Hollywood. He gives us many breathtaking camera angles, some of which are sometimes a bit shaky, which serves to make the action even more involving. Looking back at the film now, it might not appeal to a wide range of viewers. The odd characters (mainly the villains), ultra-violence, dark tone, and the sparse dialogue may seem a little too offbeat for some people.\n\nMel Gibson remains the only world-renowned actor in the whole film. He does a terrific job as the character Max, one of his best and most interesting characters. The development of Max is another intriguing component of The Road Warrior, and serves the film by giving it a human edge by featuring Max\'s slow transformation from loner to savior. Not only that, Gibson also creates a great action hero. There\'s not a moment in the film when we aren\'t rooting for Max to smash Humungus and his gang. Bruce Spence as the gyro-pilot is decent in his role and offers the film\'s few humorous moments.\n\nVirginia Hey is also pretty good as the Warrior Woman, and though the script doesn\'t exactly give her a lot to do, she plays the part well. Mike Preston also shows a lot of honor as the compound\'s leader.\n\nOn the other side of the equation are the actors who portray the villains. Surprisingly enough, though the characters are outlandish, no one ever goes over-the-top. Vernon Wells and Kjell Nilson are absolutely menacing and frightening as the lead villains, Wez and Humungus. They personify evil itself, creating characters who we truly grow to despise.\n\nTo be honest, I am a little surprised that the critics enjoyed this every bit as much as I did. The film doesn\'t delve very deeply into philosophical issues and doesn\'t exactly have a lot of grand things to say. I suppose with the acclaim this film received goes to show that critics do truly watch movies primarily for entertainment.\n\nAs I mentioned before, the film was the benchmark of a genre that grew in popularity. The premise of a loner helping a group of people in need has been used a bit too much now. Most notably is the big-budget flop, Waterworld (which is a good movie I recommend), though none have yet to match the outright intensity of The Road Warrior.'),(1495,88,'7/10','Very much significantly better than the first','ForTheMostPart1999','8 November 2022','Well done stunts and camera shots, especially for it\'s time for sure.

The Road Warrior is undoubtedly one of the most spectacular action films ever made. It\'s very rare that I grant the score of 10 for a movie, but this one gets it and deserves it. From the opening imagery and narration, it almost seems like we\'re watching an alternate reality rather than a future sci-fi film, much unlike Mad Max\'s \"A FEW YEARS FROM NOW...\" prologue. This was a film that inspired countless ripoffs and wannabes; perhaps imitation is the most sincere form of flattery (I was secretly hoping the Y2K computer bug would destroy society so that I could put on my black leather jacket, get a pair half-pair] of football shoulder pads, and a sawed-off shotgun so I could drive around the desert and kill people for their gasoline).\n\nI\'ve always loved movies presenting larger-than-life heroes.

This is widescreen with the bad guys in post punk apocalyptic costumes all after petrol to drive those fuel injected auto-mobiles and they are prepare to slaughter for it.\n\nAs far as the story goes the film owes more to spaghetti westerns as Mel Gibson is essentially the man with no name and no ties who rides into town or here a camp by a refinery and reluctantly decides to help out a sympathetic bunch of people led by Pappagallo who are trying to hold off a menacing group of marauders led by the psychotic Humungus.\n\nThe key plot line here is a tanker full of petrol which Max decides to drive leading to an exhilarating climax and plenty of good stunt work. Max is helped out by a feral boy and the strange Gyro captain but hear he is still a loner suffering from the lost of his wife and family.\n\nAlthough regarded as the best of the original Mad Max trilogy to me despite the higher budget, it is not as all out action packed as its reputation suggests.

A quirky local guy leads Max to a desert locale with fuel, but the place is lorded over by a gang of cutthroat bikers and other marauding simpletons. The heavy-duty action begins here.\n\nI like the story\'s underlying idea and its apocalyptic vision. The sound of the wind over a barren, lonesome landscape is compelling. And I like the way the story is told from the POV of a surprising character.\n\nOn the other hand, the villains are stick-figure characters with no depth. They ride around in/on their roaring go-mobiles with the most pubescent of purposes. And the simple plot is highly repetitive; some character attacks another; a second character attacks someone else, and the cycle repeats, endlessly.\n\nAlso, I could have wished for less gaudy costumes. Those helmets, that leather garb, and that awful mohawk haircut make me yearn for \"The Sound Of Music\" ... well, almost. Speaking of music, the background score here is overbearing relative to what little dialogue there is.\n\nThe concept of \"The Road Warrior\" offers an interestingly grim vision of the future. And some of the film\'s visuals are compelling. But the accent on non-stop, violent action dilutes this underlying futuristic concept, rendering a film that is mostly about angry simpletons riding around the middle of a dusty nowhere in or on their high-octane crash wagons, sans mufflers.'),(1499,88,'10/10','One helluva film!','TOMASBBloodhound','12 June 2005','Studio executives today could use a film like this one, or its predecessor right about now. The Mad Max films were thrown together with great skill on absolutely shoestring budgets and made a king\'s ransom in profits. Nowadays we just seem to get one big-budget failure after another, as the box office slump now extends into its fourteenth week.\n\nMad Max 2 (or The Road Warrior, as it is commonly called here in the USA) is an extraordinary sight to behold. The story centers on a loner (Mel Gibson) who roams the post-apocalyptic wasteland of Australia in search of gasoline so he can... I guess just keep driving. He is a man who lost his wife and child to a murderous gang of bikers in the previous film. He seems to be without a soul, or any feeling for his fellow man. One day he corners a man who tells him about a refining community besieged by a gang of ruthless outlaws. Thirsty for the large amount of fuel this community has, Max barters his way inside. To his dismay, the community has no plans to let him just take the fuel and run. They use him to provide them with a vehicle \"big enough to haul that fat tank of gas\", and by the climax of the film, he is driving the fuel through a gang of about fifty or more savages looking to take it for themselves. Max never really endears himself to anyone, but you can feel the humanity within him as he volunteers to drive the tanker. After just surviving a horrendous accident he can barely walk, but he knows he\'s their only chance.\n\nThis film is absolutely breathtaking. The characters we meet inside the walls of the refining community are stubborn and resourceful, but just not strong enough to deal with \"that vermin on machines\" waiting outside for them. The vicious gang holding the community hostage are a motley crew of desperadoes. Many are dressed like WWE combatants. Some are even dressed in MFP uniforms similar to what Max and his fellow officers wore in part one. Are they former cops gone bad, or did they murder the cops to get the uniforms? We are never told. The script refers to these men as \"GAYBOY BERSERKERS\". The various motorcycles, hot rods, and trucks used in the film have to be seen to be believed. Maybe more fuel-efficient vehicles would be a better idea for a world so short on fuel! But these souped-up vehicles make for some great chase scenes! You have to hand it to the stunt men who worked on this film. With no CGI to do the work for them, many of them were putting their lives at risk each day. Both stunt team leaders Max Aspin and Guy Norris were severely injured during filming. Aspin was driving the car that went airborne after we see the driver shot in the back with the four-way arrow gun. I believe he suffered a concussion when it landed just short of the fortress wall. Norris shattered his ankle after being launched off a motorcycle and sent flying through the air in one spectacular shot during the final chase scene.\n\nThe film has a great soundtrack, as well by Brian May.

The first was another exploitation movie about a man seeking revenge, only more riproaring than most. The character was brought back for this and it was also not supposed to lead to more.\n\nThey had more of a budget here, still none of Lucas\' engineering a whole world, with trajectory and conclusions. Here more than the first, they created a sense of world, an edge of which we happened to explore in this episode and left behind in the dust upon conclusion.\n\nA lone antihero (no longer a cop) steps out from the sands and becomes embroiled in a squabble between rival clans. The plot around an ambush, the circling savages, everything here recalls westerns. In western films it might have been a carriage of gold, or people besieged by Comanches in some desert outpost.\n\nI always thought it amusing how this is a world where gas guzzling beasts are driven around the outback for miles in search of scarce gas. Baddies are dressed in BDSM and punk attire, figments of what would have looked menacing to 80s viewers. It did create a whole futureworld as much as Bladerunner and Star Wars (and with a fraction of the means); rival gangs roaming a wasteland is now firmly entrenched as one of possible futures for mankind in the pop mind.\n\nIt\'s really the barreling heavy metal of the action that makes it, more so when you think it\'s from the time before computers when it was all something you actually crashed. Amazing to think that the filmmaker was just a doctor before embarking on the first one. He proved to be an able mechanic of image. You\'ll see some masterful editing in both.\n\nOkay, so I\'ll take Alien, Bladerunner, Terminator, when in the vicinity, in that order. But for me this is like giving the edge to Lethal Weapon over Die Hard; both wildly effective, it\'s just a matter of which cinematic world appeals to me more. In specifics it has little to offer me. The way we\'re placed inside of that world still captivates, stretches of dust that scavengers roam and where the odd enclave may be.'),(1503,88,'7/10','This is more like it','Samiam3','11 August 2010','Mad Max 2, or the Road Warrior if you will, begins with something that the first Mad Max probably should have started with; a little setting exposition. All we knew at the beginning of the first was that is was set a few years in the future, in the Australian desert. This time we are told that it is a post apocalyptic future, overrun by biker gangs, and a drop of fuel is worth more than gold.\n\nThe ending of Mad Max was disappointing but there was the promise of something epic to come. this is it. Now that we have gotten to know Mad Max, it\'s time for him to become a hero, and while he only has half as much to say in this one, he has five times as much to do. Max helps an isolated oil community fight back against an invading biker gang led by a goon in a Gladiator\'s helmet. He must help them to get to a paradise two thousand miles away, driving their precious oil tanker, while a battery of fire power and arrows comes after them.\n\nWith so many wheels on the desert road, it\'s no wonder than Mad Max 2 kicks up more dust than any action film around, The climax is reminiscent of Steven Spielberg\'s Duel, only far more epic. For a b-movie, it gets quite intense, and even though the ending comes a bit quickly, there is a sense of closure to this one, but we are still left excited for more.'),(1504,88,'10/10','the best movie Gibson has ever been in','jokeco68','21 December 2004','The first time I saw this at a friends recommendation was in 1985 on our brand new VHS vcr. I was absolutely blown away by it at the age of 16 and I still watch every few months on DVD now.I would give anything to see this on a big screen. This movie started a real trend for a lot of real crappy B movies to follow unfortunately and Mel Gibson has called this movie with an apologetic shrug \'classy B-grade trash\' which is sad because it would prove to be his best movie by far. What I truly liked about this film was its lack of dialogue and how it was smart enough to let its settings, action and costumes do the talking. Perhaps this is why Gibson didn\'t have much praise for it because he is merely a representation of the Western gunslinger in the film. I liked how there was a sketchy explanation of how the world got into such an apocalyptic mess and lets the viewer make their own conclusion to that end. It\'s not important anyways. The lack of ammunition is indicated quickly through the Wez\'s use of a wrist-strapped crossbow, the very preciousness of gasoline is established quickly as well by Max\'s anxious mopping up of it and capturing it in a few make-shift items including a dusty soldier\'s helmet.\n\nThe original Mad Max had too much dialogue and proved problematic for the 18 year old Gibson to convey the emotion of losing his family and best friend. It had it\'s moments but in the end it lost it\'s impact due to it\'s own clumsy attempt at trying to establish the family-man Max. The Road Warrior didn\'t try to attempt any deep characterizations, the pain and suffering was quick and obvious, the need to just survive in this stark world conveyed through a few spoken words and violent actions. George Miller got it right with this one, unfortunately he had to make Mad Max first to get to Mad MaxII and horribly had to make Mad MaxIII.'),(1505,88,'7/10','Road Warrior','kosmasp','19 May 2015','There is a nice introduction on the disc that explains why this wasn\'t originally called \"Mad Max 2\". You also get a \"What happened before\" segment at the beginning of the movie, bringing you up to speed, even if you hadn\'t seen the first one (which was the case for a lot of people back then). The movie is superior to the first one, which can be explained by a much bigger budget.\n\nThat budget can be seen towards the end, where you have a very fine planned and executed chase (action) sequence that stood the test of time. The stunts are good to say the least. The story comes off a bit like a western (what with a fort and all). This is the best of the three original movies, with a solid (if obvious) story-line. There is a lot violence which is almost surprising (especially since a kid is involved, just in case you have an issue with seeing young ones in peril or being initiators of violence themselves).\n\nMad Max also gets a funny side kick (something that is really helping the movie and the humor). It looks good, it does not have a bad dub (see the first Mad Max for that - but not with the bad dub please) and it\'s overall very much recommended'),(1506,88,'10/10','Concentrated testosterone, and fun','knsevy','2 May 2003','I think this may be the greatest \'car movie\' ever made.

It\'s vaguely feasible enough that you don\'t worry much about it, just accept it as a needed background to hang the fun stuff on. Oh, to be a stunt driver in this movie! Or even to be a mechanic! That would be a story to tell your children.\n\nThis is every driving fantasy I\'ve ever had, and played perfectly. I know that certainly flavors my review, but tell me that movies which are cathartic for you haven\'t affected YOU that way?\n\nBottom line: thin plot, heavy action, decent characterization.

As to the first movie where you could spot farm houses in the backdrop and such.\n\nHowever, there is a heavy undertone of homo eroticism throughout the movie. Just take a look at Humungus and his gang. Their outfits and their behavior was screaming homo eroticism.\n\nLooking past that, then \"Mad Max 2: The Road Warrior\" is actually an enjoyable movie, and this is how I remembered \"Mad Max\" to be from my childhood. So I will just forget all about the abysmal first movie.\n\nThe acting in the movie was quite good, especially Mel Gibson was doing a great job in developing Max in growing into a legendary action hero. As for the people in Humungus\' gang, well... A bit of the acting was just forced and bordering on being comedy.\n\n\"Mad Max 2: The Road Warrior\" is fast paced, lots of action throughout the entire movie, and there is a great red line throughout the course of the movie. The action scenes are well choreographed. But especially hats off for the director and film crew for the driving sequences.

After many drafts, he finally came to a satisfactory conclusion.\n\nThen, Lucas presented Star Wars to the United Artists, but they refused to budget the film, so he went to Universal Pictures, the studio that financed American Graffiti; however, it was rejected, as the film concept was \"too strange\".\n\nSuddenly, Alan Ladd Jr -head of 20th Century Fox- appeared, a man that trusted in Lucas\' genius. And that\'s how Star Wars became a reality.\n\nThe shooting of the movie was full of mishaps, problems with practical effects never done before, a bad first edit of the movie, but that didn\'t stop George from fulfilling his Space Opera. Due to those setbacks, Fox Studios began to put pressure on Lucas to finish the movie. Finally, the movie was done. On the eve of Star Wars release, 20th Century Fox, George Lucas and his cast and crew braced themselves for the worse. One way or another, May 25, 1977 would be a day they would never forget...\n\nReview:\n\nStar Wars is a modern tale of mythic adventure. It follows the journey and growth of the protagonist: Luke Skywalker. His journey of discovery is set amidst a larger struggle between the Empire and the Rebel Alliance; both parties are embroiled in a civil war. The Empire is comprised of corrupted power within a small group of leaders. These sullied leaders abuse their power over the masses with impunity. It is oppression and repression of the masses. The Empire wants to destroy the hope of the rebellion to ensure the small group of leaders can keep their power...\n\nOne of the most important features of the movie are the special effects. The use motion control was even superior to Stanley Kubrick\'s revolutionary masterpiece: \"2001: A Space Odyssey\" thanks to the creation of The Dykstraflex, the first digital motion control photography camera system developed for Star Wars on 1976. Along with an incredibly iconographic character and production design, the movie became stylistically unique.\n\nThe story and the characters are original and relatable. R2-D2 and C-3PO: the astromech as the optimistic adventurer\'s desiring to move forward. In direct opposition C-3PO, the protocol droid filled with doubt and reservations. Luke Skywalker, the brave hero, often haunted by doubts and hopes about his future journey. Obi-Wan Kenobi, the wise master and moral guidance of our hero. Han Solo, the rebellious smuggler whose personality represents tenacity. Leia, the damsel \"in distress\", a fearsome princess and general. Finally, Darth Vader, the most iconic character in the franchise, the merciless tyrant in a black suit, representing evil and final conflict of the journey.\n\nThe film score presents an emotional resonance trough a romantic 1930s Hollywood orchestral score that was commissioned for composer John Williams, who succeeded to create a haunting constellation of operatic leitmotifs.\n\nThe visual composition is authentic, as Lucas wanted a nostalgic \"filtered look\" so he kept changing key lights for a \"flashing\" effect. He used a loose, \"nervous\" frame, as in newsreels. The dramatic center was displaced, deflecting the eye to background activity, which in later films would include poetically changing weather. This first film gradually turned darker, following a symbolic color scheme where organic brown and warm gold yielded to high-tech black, white, and steely gray.\" This is authenticity is reflected in it\'s most iconic shot: the \'Binary Sunset\' sequence, which establishes the narrative through-line of the story and the world it takes place in, the main value of the scene lies in how powerfully and economically it develops Luke\'s character: As the suns begin to slowly sink in the evening sky, he gazes towards the horizon, his sense of longing for something more is palpable. Taking things further, he goes on to squint into the distance as if he could see his new future just out of reach, and for the first time we get to see him not as a kid, but for as a new hope.\n\nBooks such as \"The hero with a thousand faces\" by Joseph Campbell structured the story, The War of Vietnam inspired the battle between the Rebels and the Empire, the lifestyle of buddhist monks characterized the Jedi, real shots of warplanes made the space battles real, Kendo foreshadowed the epic lightsaber duel, Akira Kurosawa\'s storytelling influenced the focus on minor characters, Fritz Lang\'s it\'s iconic protocol droid and John Ford westerns determined it\'s soul.The fascination with filmmaking and anthropology are the components that allowed Star Wars to be compelling and human, besides being located on a galaxy far, far away.\n\n10/10'),(1510,89,'10/10','One of the most successful movies of all time (and I\'m not talking about the Box Office take)','FiendishDramaturgy','26 October 2003','What made this the hugely successful triumph it was? Was it casting, music, imagination, ingenuity, or luck?\n\nI remember opening day at the theaters. I was old enough to remember every scene, every character, every nuance of this film; having committed it to memory forever, as if I would never again be able to see this beloved, instantly loved masterpiece.\n\nI also remember that the HIT factor of this movie was so unexpected that you had to wait literal MONTHS to get the action figures promised on the cereal boxes. The pieces were still in the manufacturing process and we had to settle for coupons promising our toys in a few months. I wound up seeing this in the theaters a grand total of 36 times; much to my mother\'s dismay. She loved the movie as I did, but felt I was obsessed. Today, thirty years later, sitting here writing this review, I realize how right she was. I\'m still obsessed with this movie, and with the subsequent movies which followed. I wait in great anticipation for Episode 3. I\'m a fan, and I don\'t care what other people say about Episodes 1 & 2. I don\'t even mind the \"prequel\" factor, as the situation at the time, dictated to Lucas which movies he would do first.\n\nSee, I remember the studios saying to him that he had to choose from the three central climactic books, and trash the rest, or just trash the whole idea. He didn\'t exactly \"sell out,\" he did what he had to do to get his movie...his vision...out there for us to see and experience. I admired his decision then, and I admire it now. Episodes 1-3 are being filmed now, because Lucas had the clout, the money, and the patience to give us his vision...his complete vision and not just the three center books of a 9-book series. I realize that now, there are dozens of books, but at the time, there were nine. And while most of us were happy with Episodes 4-6 and would not have missed 1-3 and 7-9, I personally am so very glad he has taken it upon himself to give us his full vision. I have enjoyed each and every installment with the same sense of awe and joy as I did this one.\n\nThe casting was the first triumph for this cinematic milestone. Ford is a charismatic and magnetic personality and portrayed Han with a professionalism that you\'d expect from more seasoned actors. Sir Alec Guiness is an absolute joy as Obi Wan. His casting was precise and excellent in that part. Carrie Fisher portrayed Leia in a way that, up until then, had never been experienced. Most \"princess\" types before her were whining, whimpering, little snots who were incapable of anything beyond tripping and twisting their ankle in times of peril, while Fisher portrayed her character as a bold, brazen, yet sophisticated and educated woman who was aware of her surroundings and capable of defending herself and her realm with the utmost authority.\n\nAnd Mark Hamil. He was perfectly cast as the whining little boy who wanted more, but was afraid to reach for it. He grows up quite well on film in these three installments, and endears himself to the audience so much the more for it. But a cast member who is almost always left out of these reviews is Peter Mayhew. Chewbacca. His character, as a supporting character to Han\'s, was exemplary. It\'s not easy portraying a walking carpet, yet holding the attention, admiration, and love of virtual millions. I am VERY happy about his being cast as Chewy in Episode 3. Couldn\'t happen to a more deserving...or capable...fellow. Bravo! And James Earl Jones\'s voice being used as the voice of Darth Vader, was pure genius. His commanding voice haunted the dreams of countless thousands of star-struck children for generations to come. I also have to say that this movie would not have had the charm it does had it not been for Anthony Daniels\' C3P0. He is a gift and a joy.\n\nThe musical score by John Williams featured in this masterpiece was one of the contributing factors. But honestly, this movie\'s success was such a total surprise to everyone, including Lucas, that nothing could prepare the world for the aftermath of having witnessed this bona fide legend, first hand.\n\nThe story itself; replete with sub-plot after sub-plot, rich in dialog and detail, was beyond anyone\'s greatest expectations. Everyone, including Lucas, expected this movie to fail. It is a timeless classic, which I will not repeat here. There are too many movie reviews giving full details of the plot, and I won\'t be redundant beyond what I have already said.\n\nHowever, that being said, there are a few points I would like to make concerning the symbolism of this endeavor. The Force is a metaphor for the psychic abilities with which we are all born. It was also a metaphor for hope and faith, dedication and commitment to the greater state of being. The Empire is said to have been a metaphor for the Germanic Nazi \"storm troopers.\" While the Rebellion is said to have been symbolic of (what would later become) the NATO forces who defeated them.\n\nAnd then there are the effects. The effects were, in 1977, so awesome; so creative; so ahead of their time, as to ensure this movie\'s vast success for the next forty years. George Lucas enjoys an almost god-like status among sci-fi/fantasy fans worldwide.\n\nThis movie does not rate a rating. Usually, when I say that, it is because the movie is so bad, or disappointing that I don\'t have the heart to rate it.\n\nBut in this case, it far surpasses any 10/10 rating I could give it.\n\nThe Fiend :.'),(1511,89,'10/10','A film that changed the industry forever.','Sleepin_Dragon','18 September 2023','The Empire look set to continue their relentless war effort, new technology means they are pretty much unopposed, but a small band including Like Skywalker, Princess Leia and Han Solo, look to fight back.\n\nI\'m not sure what I can add that hasn\'t already been said, instead I\'ll try and imagine what it must have been like for someone, someone young perhaps, heading to the cinema in 1977, seeing this film for the first time.\n\nConsider what had gone before, people had Star Trek, and various other shows, but this film must have left audiences speechless, as there was quite literally nothing else like it.\n\nThis film changed not just sci fi, but film making in general, the sheer scale and imaginative of it shame many of today\'s mediocre offerings.\n\nYou have to admire the sheer bravery and audacity to get this film made, you wonder what doubts George Lucas had, he must have been elated when audiences turned round and fell in love with it.\n\nIt\'s funny, entertaining, exciting, jaw dropping, moving, it\'s everything you want from a movie, years on, it\'s still a masterpiece.\n\n10/10.'),(1512,89,'10/10','The film that changed the world','davidsarah','12 December 2004','Star wars made epic fantasy real.

In the U.K economic disaster was occurring(a 3 day working week, and the army collecting rubbish). It was almost like the two most technically advanced countries in the world were going backwards.

Goodfellas is my favorite drama. Face/Off is my favorite actioner. But when it comes to pure amazement, nothing beats Star Wars. We are introduced to a whole other universe with different creatures, different lifestyles, and different history. We are dropped in the middle of an intergalactic war between an empire and a rebellion that has raged for years and left the universe in ruin. It was the most fascinating thing to see when i was eleven, but to this day i am still a Star Wars nerd.\n\nThe cast of characters includes some of the coolest, funniest, and most tragic in film, and the actors who play them fit seamlessly into this new universe. Alec Guiness is flawless as Obi-Wan Kenobi, a Jedi on the run from the evil Empire. Harrison Ford is awesome as Han Solo, a smuggler and thief who helps the gang rescue the princess. But the my favorite character of all time is Darth Vader. Not only is he the coolest bad guy, but we learn in later films why he is evil and start to feel sympathetic for him. Not to mention that badass booming voice that can make ordering a pizza sound threatening.\n\nThis was not only the beginning of the best movie series ever, but it was the beginning of my love for movies. George Lucas is a genius for being able to come up with a great story and an incredible backdrop for what was supposed to be a flop, but turned into one of the best films ever.\n\n10/10'),(1516,89,'9/10','The Best of Sci-Fi Times,the Worst of sf Times','Bogmeister','25 December 2005','Though now known as \"Episode IV-A New Hope,\" for many of us, namely those of us who first saw this exhilarating entertainment in theaters back in \'77, this will always be the first \"Star Wars.\" We will always think of it as just \"Star Wars\" - plain & simple, no pretensions, no aspirations to deep film-making or high art. This is where we first met them all: Luke, Han Solo, Princess Leia, Obi-Wan Kenobi (old \'Ben\'), Chewbacca, the 2 robots C3PO & R2D2 and, of course, Darth Vader. They were instant pop culture icons; you got the sense you\'d seen them before somewhere, but were sure this wasn\'t possible. But they\'d been there before in our minds. We\'d read about them constantly in science fiction novels and short stories - tales of outer space civilizations, of spaceships zooming through asteroid belts, of exotic-looking aliens hanging around space ports. We\'d dream about them at night and try to imagine ourselves in their midst; up until then, we could only imagine such things - there were no projected images to realize such dreams. \"Forbidden Planet\" from 1956 came close, and then there were the \"Star Trek\" and \"Lost in Space\" TV series, both hampered by dime store budgets and cheesy sets. We ate \'em up since there was nothing else. Then Lucas made it real.\n\nI remember when I first got wind of the upcoming movie, to open in May of 1977, I think. I saw the first publicized poster and bought the novel adaptation. On the poster, a young man stood with some light sword raised, a princess at his feet, numerous spaceships flying all over the place. I was in my mid-teens and felt the first pulse of building excitement as I realized all those fantastic tales I\'d been reading the past few years were going to come alive on the big screen for me. It didn\'t disappoint. Luke Skywalker, who stood in for all the boys pretending to be on a galactic adventure, gets swept away from his mundane desert home smack dab into the middle of an honest-to-gosh galaxy-wide civil war! The strength of the narrative is / was amazing. There are no slow spots and you can\'t wait for the next scene during the entire experience; and, experience is the better description for it, rather than just \'movie.\' You can\'t wait, for example, for the moment when Luke actually meets the princess; what will happen then? It\'s a textbook case of an exciting narrative and what I believe makes this superior to all the sequels (knowing that many feel \"The Empire Strikes Back\" is superior - I must disagree).\n\nThe one character you really can\'t wait to see again is the ominous Vader, naturally. The instant he steps into view during the first few minutes of the story, you just know this is the ultimate villain. This is the baddest of the bad, the coolest of the cool, the supreme uber-evildoer of the entire galaxy. You just know it by his stance, by his attitude, and by the electric chill that runs through your frail form as he steps down the corridor, moving into the annals of film history with one fell swoop. You can\'t wait to see what he does next, what nefarious action will send someone or some planet to its doom. Sure, he seems under the control of Tarkin (Cushing) here and later, the Emperor, but you just know he\'s simply biding his time until he takes over the whole damn universe. There is no precedent for Vader, and nothing close to him after. He\'s at his best here where there\'s still much mystery attached to his dark frightful form, a minion of Satan and Nazi stormtroopers all rolled into one.\n\nThis was also the movie-experience which catapulted Harrison Ford (Solo) into superstardom. He seems almost childish here, not really straining to create a character, and it\'s this flip charm that makes it work, against all odds. He really does appear to have stepped out of the pages of some juvenile space opera, laser guns blazing, all snide remarks and foolhardy bravado. But he also becomes the older brother figure to Luke, who cannot carry the story by himself. Hamill, whose movie career began & ended with Luke, epitomizes the center of destiny for a galaxy. Both humble and arrogant, he\'s perfect in the role. Fisher\'s main surprise is that she\'s not all sugar and sweet as one would expect of a princess. These three characters evolved in the next two films, but they were always at their best here, icons given life for a short period - but also forever in film. The same could be said for Alec Guinness as Kenobi, a first class act all the way. You almost believe this elderly warrior could topple an empire, given enough time.

Originally conceived as a serialized popcorn movie in the manner of the old action movies that Lucas grew up with, Star Wars surpassed even George\'s keen and bombastic imagination to become a central part of movie history.\n\nThere are countless tales of the making of this movie; how Lucas never believed he would get the chance to complete the series, how it spawned an industry and made the name of nearly everyone who touched it a household word. But what that does not reveal, nor do the much diminished prequels, is the sheer joy and excitement these movies generated.\n\nIt was a once in a lifetime experience.

The galaxy is in the grip of a massive rebellion against a tyrannical and oppressive empire, but on Luke\'s home planet, it\'s something you only dare speak of in a whisper.\n\nAlong come two robots, \"Droids\" for short, who inadvertently involve Luke in a stellar attempt to contact an old wizard named Ben Kenobi, who lives in the caves near Luke\'s home.\n\nThe rest is history, and there isn\'t a person alive in the civilized world who doesn\'t have at least some awareness of the epic story that unfolds. Luke\'s rise from adolescent obscurity on Tatooine to a leading role in the greatest struggle of all time is told with humor, action, adventure, and always a sense of story that is unmatched on the screen or on the page.\n\nWith the completion of the prequel trilogy, these films are enjoying a renewed popularity among a generation that never saw the films on the big screen, and the theatric revivals are almost guaranteed.

Everyone everywhere else is standing in line, and we got right in!\" Then, two hours later, I was asking myself, \"What the hell? THAT was what all the hoopla is all about?\" I\'d seen better science fiction flicks as a kid in the 50s.\n\nPrior to seeing it, a co-worker had gushed about it, and I asked him what it was about. He told me the plot, and when he got done, I asked, \"And then...?\" I thought he\'d described the opening half hour. And he said, \"That\'s the story. That\'s all of it.\" After watching it, I was still asking that question, \"Where is the rest of the story?\"\n\nThe plot was simplistic, the dialog inane (when everyone thought that about the three new Star Wars episodes, they were in the majority), the characters really \'flat\' and not very interesting. C3P0 and R2D2 as comic relief were just plain inadequate.\n\nTo this day, I think people were just sheep, thinking that they had to say wonderful things about this movie, so they did. The amazing thing to me is that 30 years later, they are still not seeing this as the average B-movie that it is.\n\nLook, I LIKE Harrison Ford, and I LIKE the other actors in the movie, especially Alec Guiness. Okay, Mark Hamill wasn\'t Larry Olivier, but he is at least likable. And James Earl Jones has the best voice ever. But for this movie to be considered one of the best 20 movies of all time? Color me out of the mainstream.\n\nI agree with probably 8 out of the other 19 top-20 movies, so I must not be too freaking alien. Why is this movie given such status? I just don\'t get it.'),(1521,89,'mentalcritic','The original version was brilliant...','31 March 2003','Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.','I was actually born about a year after this film first premiered, but being a member of a family that was the first on the block to get such things as the VCR and the proper Hi-Fi system allowed me to catch this film in a number of different formats in the years ranging from 1982 to 1997. I think it is safe to say that without this film, I would have had no idea how truly evil a thing Pan And Scan is, or why multi-channel audio is such a damned important thing to have in the home theatre environment.\n\nOf course, I also knew that the film wasn\'t perfect. I could see a number of small problems where Lucas\' budget just didn\'t quite go far enough, or where there just wasn\'t enough time to accomplish what was wanted. So when the announcement was made that in 1997, each film would be presented with improved special effects and footage that could not be integrated in the original cut for reasons of budget or practicality, I was excited.\n\nFor the most part, I was overjoyed to see the new footage or effects. Mos Eisley now looks like a real city or port of commerce, without the viewer\'s sense of disbelief at the seemingly deserted streets needing to be suspended. The flight of the X-Wings towards the Death Star in its original form was very good, a marvel of its time, but when George finally got to show it the way he wanted to, it was almost the equivalent of watching the helicopters of Apocalypse Now decimating the village to the tune of Ride Of The Valkyries. The wonderfully composed tracking shots especially made the battle look almost as if it really happened and Lucas was just there to take pictures. And Jabba? Well, he doesn\'t look all that real, granted, but it was just nice to have that one piece of footage in order to make the appearance of Boba Fett in Episode V and the entire prologue of Episode VI make a bit more sense, especially to dullards.\n\nUnfortunately, there are a number of times when Lucas just goes too far in his quest to improve his work. Sometimes you can only do so much to anything before it starts to look overdone. Of course, I am talking about the scene between Han and Greedo in the cantina. In the original version, we are led to believe Han is a scoundrel who only cares about himself, giving us one of the best character arcs in the whole trilogy. It is also a great tribute to Sergio Leone, a nice reference to when Tuco shoots a potential assassin from his bathtub and tells the corpse \"When you have to shoot, shoot, don\'t talk!\". Modifying this scene so it looks like Greedo shot first is an insult on a few levels. It insults Greedo as a character, making him look like one of the most incompetent bounty hunters in the galaxy. It insults the audience, who even at the age of six should no that you\'d have to be blind, drunk, brain-damaged, or all three, to miss from that distance. Lastly, it insults the character of Han Solo by destroying a vital piece of said character arc. Watching Han go from scum to a leader of men, a space-age version of King Aragorn even, was one of the best things about the original Star Wars trilogy.\n\nThe story itself is the stuff of classics in that it shows the most unlikely of heroes doing things that everyone else claims to be impossible. What Lucas got right in terms of pacing and plot here is exactly where he went wrong in the prequels, in that he makes the jump from location to location seem important to the plot and totally natural, rather than forced and choppy. The story and sense of adventure makes one forget that there are really only three major locations other than the inside of a space ship.\n\nOverall, the original Star Wars rates an eight out of ten. If Lucas had applied some common sense in conjunction with his rampant desire for revisionism, I would give it a ten, but as one critic who is famous for his negativity once said about Episode II, when was the last time anyone told George Lucas no? Still, this is a classic that should be shown to future generations as an example of how an imagination and enough literacy to realise it will open doors for you when nothing else will.'),(1522,89,'10/10','Legendary piece of cinema','UniqueParticle','16 January 2020','Only seen the original Star Wars films a few times, I tend to forget how great of a magical experience it is!

The particular stand outs in this respect I feel are: Han Solo, the wise cracking bounty hunter with a tendency for arrogance that makes every scene as entertaining as possible. Secondly there is Darth Vader, who is the optometry of cool, scathing evil who poses as the ultimate villain.\n\nSurprising to me, the cinematography and special effects have held up all this time. Although there are some minor issues, one particularly notable one is during the scene where Luke is training with the training droid aboard the Millennium Falcon there are a few frame skips where Luke extends and contracts his lightsaber. Other than this though, the cinematography and special effects are amazing to have held up, particularly the shots of the Empire\'s space fleet moving through space which are absolutely stunning.\n\nOne of the things that absolutely makes this film for me is the magnificent score, composed by John Williams. This score, while being one of the most iconic scores of all time, manages to make every single scene, fitting the mood of the scene perfectly.\n\nThe story as well is fantastic, there is never a dull moment; every second of it an absolute thrill ride.

The theatrical release is a 2-plus hour-long studio edit. The director\'s cut is 3-plus hour-long edit that was released later. I watched both versions back-to-back, and without question, the director\'s cut is the superior. It\'s not just a matter of additional footage putting more meat on the bone--more heart is added to the film as well.\n\nThe movie is a violent and gritty portrayal of the Crusades era in medieval times, but wrestles artfully with complex issues of faith, morality, justice and diversity and what it means to live a godly life. Apparently, the studio decided such thematic depth was a drawback and that audiences are mostly superficial morons, so they insisted on an edit that presented it as an action movie, leaving in just enough character development to feebly sew the action scenes together. In the process, not only character motivation was lost, but important plot developments in the story.\n\nAfter watching the shorter edit first--which seemed disjointed and filled with holes in the way of crappy edits--I had to go look up the movie\'s synopsis online to understand what the hell I had watched. In the director\'s cut, it was much clearer. But the biggest difference is the thought-provoking character development and dialogue scenes throughout that bring an intelligence to the primitive times being depicted.\n\nAt the end of the studio edit, I felt uninspired and filled with a sense that the movie had many missed opportunities.\n\nAt the end of the director\'s cut, I felt I had seen a real movie with real ideas.

However, being an enthusiast of the history of the crusader states, I would like to mention some historical facts and accuracies that generated the film.\n\nFor a start, all the main characters of the film are historical figures, from Balian to the unfortunate Baldwin IV (oftenly referred as \"Baldwin the Leper\"). However, the only connection of Balian and Sybilla was that he indeed helped her defend Jerusalem and negotiated its subsequent surrender to Saladin. However, he was not only a political opponent of her husband (Guy de Lusignan), but also of HERS.\n\nYou see, Sibylla actually loved Guy enough as to fight to make him a king, even if the barons of the kingdom were against him. She actually tricked them: She agree to divorced him before her coronation, with the only term to choose herself her new husband. When the barons accepted, she just chose to remarry Guy and established him in the throne of Jerusalem. Balian was married with her stepmother, mother of her half sister Isabella (completely ignored in the film). He conspired with Maria to have another noble, Conrad of Montferrat, marry Isabella, giving Conrad a stronger claim to the kingdom.\n\nSibylla actually succeeded her son from a previous marriage (Baldwin V), not her brother, as the film suggests. He was a child-king that succeeded his leper uncle but lived only for one year. Indeed Guy was captured in the Battle of Hattin. When Saladin was besieging the Holy City (and Sybilla personally led the defense) and she was permitted to escape to Tripoli with her daughters. However she died of an epidemic 3 years later in Tyre, the only city in the kingdom that did not fall. Her daughters also died of the same epidemic, and Guy (by now released) lost the kingdom of Jerusalem and was compensated with the Lordship of Cyprus by Richard the Lionheart.\n\nBalian died 3 years later. He NEVER retired from the politics of the kingdom as the film suggests.'),(1534,90,'7/10','Entertaining!','Antagonisten','2 May 2005','I can start by admitting that i\'m a fan of \"Gladiator\". And why do i mention this? Because there are more similarities between \"Gladiator\" and this movie besides having the same director.\n\nWhat struck me first about this movie was the visual style. Ridley Scott is just one of the best directors right now when it comes to this. Every shot feels thought-through, every color balanced. Most of the time though he still manages to avoid the clinical style of many other directors focused on visuals. \"Gladiator\" felt somewhat artificial to me when i watched it the first time around, and even more so when watching it on DVD. Many of the special effects-shots are simply not that well-made. \"Kingdom of Heaven\" though takes full opportunity of the advancements made in technology. The movie looks awesome to say the least.\n\nThe script is no revolution of coherence or cohesion, yet it works rather well for this type of movie. Because this is more pure entertainment than anything else. In the press material Ridley Scott stated himself that this should be seen more as entertainment than historical facts. Which is absolutely fine by me i might add, at least as long as he states this beforehand. Perhaps the most disturbing things is for instance the way that Orlando Bloom goes from clueless blacksmith to full-fledged sword-wielding knight in 15 minutes movie-time.\n\nAnd the actors? Orlando Bloom is in my opinion one of the most over-rated actors around today. Here though he\'s better than i\'ve seen him before. I think the main thing is that he manages to act and look more like an adult this time, while in most previous movies he has felt almost childish. The rest of the cast consist mostly of quite well-known names and they all do a fine job, making this movie quite well-acted although it\'s not exactly Shakespeare...\n\nAll things said and done i found this movie to be very entertaining. It\'s visually stunning, reasonably well acted with a decent script and some nice characters. What it lacks in coherence and story it makes up for with a strong and quick pace (for the genre) and some truly impressive action scenes. Wolfgang Petersson and Oliver Stone should watch this before they even think of making another historic epic.

It stars Orlando Bloom, Eva Green, Marton Csokas, Jeremy Irons, Liam Neeson, Alexander Siddig, David Thewlis, Ghassan Massoud and Edward Norton. Cinematography is by John Mathieson and music scored by Harry Gregson-Williams.\n\nDirector\'s Cut, two words that has these days come to mean a marketing ploy to get the home movie fan to part with more cash. Except maybe when they call it something else, such as Unrated Edition or Extended Edition, the Director\'s Cut has rarely been more than the original theatrical version with some added bits sewed back in. Case in point Ridley Scott\'s own Gladiator. But Scott is a big advocate of the home formats available to us, and what he says in his introduction on these releases are always telling. Kingdom of Heaven: Director\'s Cut is one of the rare cases that deserves the label, it is the cut Scott wanted and with 45 minutes extra in the film, it\'s now a fully formed epic and without doubt a better film than the one the theatrical cut suggested.\n\nNutshell plotting finds the story set during the Crusades of the 12th century. Balian (Bloom) is a French village blacksmith who after finally meeting his father Godfrey (Neeson), sets him on a course to aid the city of Jerusalem in its defence against the Muslim leader Saladin (Massoud). Saladin is battling to reclaim the city from the Christians. It\'s a fictionalised account of Balian de Ibelin the man, but with the Crusades featuring so rarely in movies it\'s good to see one with attention to detail in relation to the events and time period.\n\nNow this version exists there is no reason to visit the theatrical cut, for although this has one or two missteps in the narrative, big holes have been plugged and characters importantly expanded. Benefiting the most are Eva Green as Sibylla, and Bloom himself as Balian. The former now gets substance on why she transforms from a measured princess to a borderline head-case, and the latter gets a back story which helps us understand why he does what he does. Both actors performances are seen in better light as their characters become more defined. Neeson and Norton, too, also get more screen time, and that can never be a bad thing.\n\nIn this day and age the topicality of the film as regards Muslims and Christians is obviously hard to ignore, but Scott and Monahan are not in the market for political posturing. Scott had long wanted to do a film about The Crusades, to make it an historical epic adventure reflecting the period, and he has achieved that without head banging messages. In fact the culmination of the films major battle comes by way of tolerance, compassion and mutual respect, not by over the top histrionics or side picking. It\'s a crucial point to note that the makers have not demonized the Arab leaders, both Saladin and Nasir (Siddig) are portrayed as intelligent and cultured men of standing. Their drive and determination coming off as respectful as Balian\'s defence of Jerusalem is. They also provide the film with two of its best acting performances. Impressive considering the film is full of very good acting turns.\n\nIt will come as no surprise to fans of Scott\'s work to find that Kingdom of Heaven is tremendous on production value. Filled out with astonishing visuals and no overuse of CGI, it\'s arguably Scott\'s best production: it\'s certainly his most ambitious. Filmed in Spain and Morocco, the makers easily whisk us back centuries to the France and Jerusalem of the time, the ability to plant us firmly in the time frame is not to be understated. Mathieson (Gladiator) is a big part of that, his colour lensing for France (metallic cold blues) and Jerusalem (dusky yellow and brown hues) is a visual treat and integral to the feel of the story. While Gregson-Williams\' score rarely gets a mention, but it\'s very at one with Scott\'s vision, a delightful mix of ethnic strains, mystical flair and medieval emphasis. Scott also ups the ante for visceral battles, the horrors of war never more vivid as they are here. Supremely constructed, the siege of Jersualem is one of the finest in cinema, the first sight of fireballs igniting the night sky bringing the hairs on the back of the neck standing to attention. It\'s just one of many great moments that form part of Scott\'s breath taking epic.\n\nBadly treated on cinema release by the studio, who even marketed that cut badly, Kingdom of Heaven: Director\'s Cut is these days worthy of a revisit and deeper inspection. For rich rewards await the genre faithful. 9.5/10'),(1537,90,'6/10','Cheesy nonsense with some neat crowd scenes','Bojo375','25 March 2021','I reviewed the director\'s cut in hopes it would change my lukewarm opinion from having seen the shortened version on release.

But a scene where Hospitaller guides Balian after Balian survives an attack by Guy\'s men looked a bit supernatural.\n\nI am generous with a 9 cos the movie is very entertaining.\n\nWud have easily rated it a 10 if the makers wud have given more footage to the character of Saladin, a true chivalrous knight.\n\nIt is equally true that his generosity, his piety, devoid of fanaticism, that flower of liberality and courtesy which had been the model of our old chroniclers, won him no less popularity in Frankish Syria than in the lands of Islam - René Grousset (writer).\n\nDespite the Crusaders\' slaughter when they originally conquered Jerusalem in 1099, Saladin granted amnesty and free passage to all common Catholics and even to the defeated Christian army, (the Greek Orthodox Christians were treated even better, because they often opposed the western Crusaders).'),(1539,90,'7/10','Not quite heavenly, though far from hellish','TheLittleSongbird','2 October 2019','\'Kingdom of Heaven\' had an immensely talented cast going for it, despite being unsure about seeing Orlando Bloom in an especially substantial lead role. It also looked great from the trailer, and have liked a good deal of Harry Gregson-Williams\' work which can be one of the better components of films. Ridley Scott is not the most consistent of directors, his best films like \'Alien\' and \'Blade Runner\' are brilliant but lesser films such as \'Robin Hood\' are really not good (personal opinion of course).\n\nThere are also films of his that are much better in the director\'s cut version. \'Legend\' is one such example, but the biggest one for me is \'Kingdom of Heaven\'. Found it a very mixed bag as the theatrical/ non-director\'s cut version and found a lot of issues with it (and this is actually forgetting the historical inaccuracies), such as choppy storytelling, erratic pacing and underwritten characters on top of Orlando Bloom and the dialogue. While it is still not a perfect film still in the director\'s cut version, it is a big improvement and some of what were major problems in the theatrical version are corrected.\n\nNot all though. Do still find Orlando Bloom charisma-void and out of his depth, have nothing against him but this role was a meaty one, even more so in the director\'s cut where he is more complex, and needed a lot of authority and a wide range of emotions and to me Bloom didn\'t have enough of either.\n\nSome of the middle of the film stalls a bit in the pace, the storytelling not always going very far. Although the characters are much more interesting in the director\'s cut edition, a few of them could still have gotten into more depth such as those with not much screen time still and the same goes with the themes, also did that the messaging at times could have been more subtle.\n\nImprovements are many though. The characters generally are far more interesting and better developed, Eva Green\'s went from one that one questioned the presence of and was hugely underwritten to a well fleshed out character. They interacted more convincingly and not in as stilted a fashion. Despite some aimlessness in the middle, the pace is less erratic and doesn\'t jump around as much. The story is uneven still, but there is generally more cohesion and less choppiness, more of a sense of resolution with the vast amount going on and for me the contemporary relevance was a good thing.\n\nDialogue flows better and is less awkward, quite intelligent here too.\n\nBoth editions cannot be faulted visually. It is gorgeously shot with lots of atmosphere and the costumes and sets are stunningly evocative, with the siege especially being quite breath-taking. In fact, the action was very tense and powerful in both versions as well but especially in the director\'s cut. Harry Gregson Williams\' score rouses and also has emotional impact, the director\'s cut does it more justice and a better job is done complementing everything whereas in the theatrical version it was the case of a great score deserving a much better film. Scott directs everything skillfully which is remarkable considering there was a lot to balance. The messaging and everything regarding tolerance and the historical inaccuracies were much criticised and still are, they weren\'t as big an issue for me.\n\nWith the exception of Bloom, the cast are very good. The standouts being an against type Edward Norton who gives a lot of complexity and intensity to his character and Gasshan Massoud showing how to do cool and menacing wonderfully. Eva Green\'s performance is deeply felt and Jeremy Irons shows a lot of dignity and restraint here.\n\nOverall, didn\'t care for the theatrical version, but this review is namely for the director\'s cut which is an infinitely better, if imperfect, version and is a fairer way to judge the film on. My thoughts though. 7/10'),(1540,90,'10/10','Director\'s Cut of Kingdom of Heaven is visually stunning and a superb film','Holt344','8 February 2020','Kingdom of Heaven, Ridley Scott\'s epic historical film that many found bad with the theatrical cut myself have never seen it but I went straight to the Director\'s Cut which is the definitive version and I agree. The whole production is massive and impressive, cinematography and the direction of Ridley Scott makes every scene visually stunning, making every scene stand out with expensive and incredible sets. It didn\'t take long for me to get immersed into the 12th Century and Balian\'s adventure to Jerusalem as it felt that I was there with them. Now this movie isn\'t for anyone as it\'s over three hours long but I found it amazing from start to finish and my interest with that period of time, the medieval times helped a lot. For me it\'s a masterpiece in its genre, the Director\'s Cut that is.\n\nThe ensemble cast is massive and the cast who plays the respective characters all do an excellent job, bringing the characters to justice and their best to portray the real people behind the characters. What I loved is that every character isn\'t black and white, there\'s lots of grey characters that you can\'t really place in any category of evil or good. Orlando Bloom does a great job in leading the movie as we see it mostly from his eyes, the big names around him makes it the fantastic ensemble they are. The costume and prop department are one of the best things about the movie as without it, it wouldn\'t really feel immersive or realistic but what we got was a impressive amount of swords, flags, costumes and armor and when they wear the costumes and swords they become the characters.'),(1541,90,'7/10','Sometimes Wonderful . Often Irritating','Theo Robertson','18 February 2008','I\'d heard a lot about KINGDOM OF HEAVEN when it was released in 2005 . Most of the reviews were rather uncomplimentary so I made a point of missing it until it was broadcast on Channel 4 last night and as I write this review I remember a lot of beautiful things about this movie . Unfortunately I can remember far more things that annoyed me\n\nRidley Scott has been swotting up on the films and technique of David Lean and in many ways Scott is a natural successor to that legendary film director . The battle scenes are even better than the ones seen in Jackson\'s THE TWO TOWERS and RETURN OF THE KING and at no time did I believe I was watching an unconvincing CGI battle fest , just an army of thousands of extras walloping each other over the head like you\'d see in the greatest Hollywood epics of yesteryear . Scott has also assembled a truly great cast that includes household names like Neeson and Irons alongside very effective character actors like Norton , Glen , Thewlis , Sheen and Gleeson . It must have been something of a gamble for Scott to cast pretty boy Bloom in the lead role since he\'s the sort of \" movie star \" who\'s only famous because of his good looks rather than any outstanding thespian ability but Orlando Bloom probably gives his greatest performance in this film . The only thing that the director Can be criticised for is an over reliance of slow motion during the battle scenes but apart from that everything else on screen is Oscar worthy , though since Scott was under rewarded at award ceremonies you get the feeling that he was trying a little too hard to win an Oscar\n\nThere\'s an old saying that \" if a film is good then it\'s down to the director and if it\'s bad it\'s down to the screenwriter \" and this is certainly true of KINGDOM OF HEAVEN . Throughout the running time I was left scratching my head wondering about characters motives and why certain characters did certain things and let\'s not ignore the clichés of \" You are a brave warrior so I will let you live \" type moments . Some people claim that the studio should be held responsible rather than screenwriter William Monahan since they made several cuts to the final print and there\'s a disjointed feel to the narrative . Perhaps this is true but I wonder how many people watching this on DVD or on television like me had to keep logging in to the wikipedia in order to understand what was happening on screen . It should also be pointed out that there\'s a rather politically correct feel to the story with neither Christians or Muslims being portrayed as out and out villains with only the Knight templars being portrayed as evil . One wonders if the knight templars were still in existence today if they\'d be shown in this way . In many ways it\'s like watching a second world war film where Germans are shown as being as much as victims of Nazism as those in the occupied territories . Honestly I was expecting the templars to goose step in to battle while proclaiming \" I vos only obeying orders \" . It says something about the quality of director and cast when they can rise above such one dimensional scripting\n\nIn short this is a film that is sometimes beautiful and stunning but often irritating , confused and plodding . It is well directed and acted but you often get the impression that it tries too hard and this works against it . Historians probably won\'t like it and you get the feeling no one will love KINGDOM OF HEAVEN and everyone will give slightly different reasons as to why they didn\'t love it . In short it\'s a very flawed masterpiece'),(1542,90,'5/10','I Had Wanted to Like this Movie, Well...','lovefalloutkindagamer','27 March 2023','I had high hopes for this film. Not sure where to begin, but as a lover of epics I can say that this one simply falls short.\n\nI guess I can start with the positives.\n\nThis is one of the best casted films out there. The score is good, though not iconic. I do love that although this movie is about the crusades, it isn\'t afraid to criticize them. The costumes are well designed and add an element to the film that elevates it (much like the costumes in \'The 10 Commandments\' had done for it). The fight scenes are hit and miss; some are excellent and some are very poor which is a bit jarring to be honest.\n\nEverything I have stated I had expected out of this film from the get go, but I had assumed that it would be enough to get me to love it - regardless of the pacing, plot or any other reason.\n\nBoy was I wrong! LMAO!\n\nIt is SO HARD to give out the criticism this film deserves without spoiling it. I suppose I can put it like this: this movie is more in line with a film like \'Troy\' than one like \'Gladiator\'.\n\nThere are many pointless subplots that aren\'t given any background or followed through to a conclusion. That makes it hard to endure the three hours it takes to get a glimpse of the highlights this movie has to offer (yes, I watched the Director\'s Cut).\n\nThe main character is a mary sue. This guy, a widowed blacksmith, is also for some reason an amazing fighter and expert horseman suddenly. I hate this character writing just as much as I hated Rey\'s in the star wars sequels.\n\nThe love plot was entirely unnecessary and did nothing for the overall movie. That was screen time that should have been given to any of the other subplots or used to better develop the main characters of the film. And as much as I love Jeremy Irons, his character needed less screen time. \'Sibylla\' needed less screen time. \'Raynald\' needed less screen time. \'The Hospitaller\' needed less screen time. This movie refuses to focus on the characters that are the most important. It should have given more to the main three that drive the overall plot: Saladin, Guy de Lusignan and Balian. There is no justification for Guy\'s thoughts or actions, so he is reduced to the complexity of a cartoon villain.\n\nFinal word.\n\nLooking over these notes there is one thing I feel I failed to elaborate on and it is a positive: this is a very aesthetically rich film. The set pieces, the landscapes and - like I previously mentioned - the costumes are the best crafted parts of the film. It\'s almost worth watching for that alone. Almost.\n\nI do believe those who have not seen many epic films or those simply starved for a good crusader movie, will praise this one highly. But for me I wouldn\'t even consider placing it in the epic category for it is wanting. It\'s a great idea for a film that was executed poorly.\n\n5/10 I don\'t ever see myself sitting through three more hours to watch this one again.'),(1543,90,'0U','Great','4 February 2020','Was this review helpful?

I saw it in the theater but the reason it\'s so great is because of the 4-Disc Director\'s Cut, which is a must own for any KOH fan.\n\nStory: A well written script, KOH is about a blacksmith whose wife has committed suicide and he seeks out to redeem her in the city of Jerusalem, but ends up defending the people in the great battle against the Muslims.\n\nCast: The cast for this film was outstanding. One would at first question Orlando Bloom as the leading role of Balian (let\'s face it, he\'s no Russell Crowe), but this is by far his best main character performance. Liam Neeson is great as usual, as Balian\'s long lost father. Jeremy Irons is a great pick because he looks like he\'s from the crusades and his voice is undeniable. Obviously he\'s a great actor as well. Eva Green does very well for basically being the only woman in the film and she also fits the the time period well. Martin Csoskas give a great show as the bloodthirsty wanna-be king. Brendan Gleeson.. Do I even need to say anything? The man is incredible. He\'s so great at being the jerk. Ghassan Massoud and Alexander Siddig do great as playing Muslims in the film. Edward Norton is completely astounding in his uncredited performance as the leper King Baldwin. He is one of my favorite characters in the film.\n\nMusic: The music score for this movie is definitely in the top 10. Harry Gregson-Williams delivers a powerful score in this one. Gregson-Williams was a great pick though straying from Ridley Scott\'s usual Hans Zimmer.\n\nOther: The sets, the costumes, the editing, the cinematography are all superior. They are all very authentic and beautiful and add to the films realness.\n\nRidley Scott is brilliant. You can definitely see a resemblance of Gladiator in KOH, which is a great thing because who doesn\'t like Gladiator. His ability to create worlds is unlike any other director in history. The 4-Disc Director\'s Cut allows you to see more of what Ridley Scott\'s methods are like.\n\n4-Disc Director\'s Cut: It has everything you want to see. It puts approximately 45 minutes back into the film and what a great 45 minutes it is. It goes much more in depth especially with Eva Green\'s Character Sibylla. It includes all the essentials that you would want in a 4-Disc set.\n\nOverall this is a great film and has become one of my very favorites since the past year or so. There is something about it that even makes it rival the quality of Gladiator. It was very underrated by critics and was very well deserving of some Oscars. Watch it!'),(1545,90,'7/10','Starring Christian Bale would have made this phenomenal','vh8686','14 March 2023','Don\'t get me wrong, Orlando Bloom still does pretty well given the weight of the character, but he is often quite muted in a role that demands a stronger screen presence. The world hadn\'t seen Christian Bale in Batman Begins yet and Bloom was fresh off the heels of Lord of the Rings and Pirates of the Caribbean so its difficult to know who else the studios would have allowed to fill the role at the time.\n\nI am of course referring only to the Director\'s Cut, as I remember being very underwhelmed by the original theatrical release. There are snippets of things making it into the CUT the probably still should have stayed on the cutting room floor, but the overall effect is that the film is much more nuanced and better paced. Its not hard to see this rivalling Gladiator with a few adjustments but I\'ll take it as is.\n\nEdward Norton and Eva Green are perfect in their roles. Just as good are Brendan Gleeson, David Thewlis, and Liam Neeson.\n\nThe only other thing that could have made the film better would be if it were a little less obvious about its criticism of Christianity during the middle-ages. It just seems too easy to portray Christians as hypocrites and even though I\'m all for a little religion bashing, I just prefer it to be disguised a little better.\n\nAnyway, solid film 7.6/10.'),(1546,90,'8/10','excellent, fair to islam, sweeping, narrative could have used tightening...','Duk','7 May 2005','I really enjoyed this movie. The way the movie started in Europe and how dark it was there... and the journey to Jerusalem... just wonderful stuff up to that point.\n\nLiam Neeson, as usual, is just SO GOOD, you wish he had more screen time.\n\nOrlando Bloom, actually surprisingly, was able to carry the movie as a lead. I was surprised he had the heft to do it, but I agree with the critic who said that the beard helped. He was a man, not a boy.\n\n\nBattle scenes... incredible. I was really surprised that they could wow me, since we\'ve been numbed by the quality of battle scenes in so many previous movies, but they did a great job.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd it portrays Christianity particularly religious men, VERY badly (the Priest who steals the cross from Bloom\'s wife\'s corpse... the Bishop in Jerusalem who\'s ready to convert to Islam at the first sign of defeat... and who also wants to abandon the civilians... the knights templar...) I thought this got a tad gratuitous. There were really NO GOOD Christian FIGURES IN THE MOVIE. The only good purported Christians were basically acting Agnostic (Bloom, Neeson, etc.) The actual religious Christians were made out to be hypocrites.\n\nMeanwhile Saladhudin was a man of honor.. but also somewhat moderate.\n\n\n\nBut the movie tackled a HUGE topic and tackled it fairly well. I just wish there was a better script to handle the compelling personal journey for Orlando Bloom (from widower, murderer seeking redemption, lost bastard son) that was PROMISED at the beginning.\n\nIt seems that as soon as he brings water to his father\'s old land, he\'s just about done his journey, and it turns into a simple historical battle movie.

Orlando Bloom, surrounded by a very impressive cast, stars in this political interpretation of the taking of Jerusalem by Saladin (wonderfully portrayed by Ghassan Massoud). The supporting cast is tremendous. I\'ve already mention Massoud, but I feel that I should also give kudos to Jeremy Irons, Eva Green, Liam Neeson, Marton Csokas and Alexander Siddig for their laudable efforts.\n\nRidley Scott is a master movie maker and almost always excels in direction and cinematography. However, I got the sense that a great deal must have been cut out of the original script - material which might have helped with continuity - perhaps a few years worth of military and hand-to-hand fighting experience on the part of the lead. Also, the slowing and speeding of film in battle scenes has really become a cliché, and no longer has the impact it had in Braveheart, Black Hawk Down, etc. It\'s time to develop new techniques or go back to the classical methods. Though I am sure some will disagree, as there are certainly some continuity and plot problems in this film (how does Blooms character become a master tactician while floating on a piece of wreckage en route to Jerusalem?, for example), I felt that this had all of the makings of a great film - a compelling subject, a great director, an excellent cast, and a good script.\n\nUnfortunately - and I say this with some trepidation because I really like the guy - Orlando Bloom just wasn\'t the right guy for this role. Perhaps he is simply too young and inexperienced, but I felt that his performance was often two-dimensional and just a little derivative of Viggo Mortenson\'s Aragorn. Scenes that called for emotion were met with Shakespearean vocalization, but little to no facial expression, and very little body language, and though it was not really the centerpiece of the drama, his relationship with the superb Eva Green was, in fact, more compelling than either the central plot or the heroics and antiheroics of medieval warfare going on around him.\n\nThis film is worth seeing, if nothing else for the intelligent and understated political messages woven into it. But I think it could have been a much better film than it was.'),(1549,90,'10/10','A Nutshell Review: Kingdom of Heaven','DICK STEEL','4 May 2005','Kingdom of Heaven in 2005 will be what Gladiator was in 2000. Ridley Scott has delivered a worthy follow up to his Oscar winner, which is also based on medieval times, with a central heroic character, and supporting casts of characters based on history.\n\nThe sets are as spectacular, instead of just Rome and the Collesuem, we have the Middle East and Jerusalem. The costumes are beautiful, from intricately remade Knights armour, to the desert garb of the Muslim warriors. The soundtrack is a mixture of sounds with middle eastern influences, but somehow pales in comparison with Gladiator and lacks a central theme.\n\nMuch is said about how the film portrays religion, given the sensitive subject of the Crusades, but I feel that Ridley has achieved a wonderful balance between how Christianity and Islam are portrayed. Both are given fair airtime on their ideologies, and the film tries to preach (pardon the pun) about tolerance, yet highlights the dangers of fanatical followers of both religions, of misguidance from men in search of worldly power.\n\nWhich Christianity took a beating - where senseless battles are waged in the name of Christ, where insensitivity breed contempt. Preists are cast in negative light and given lines like \"convert to Islam, repent later\" when all around seems lost. It is emphasized in the show that what matters is in your head and in your heart - that noble actions speak louder than mere empty and repetitive \"praise the Lord\" chants, as if that will protect you during Judgement Day.\n\nOrlando Bloom plays Balian, a blacksmith who became a fugitive, but inherited land and army from his father, Godfrey, played by Liam Neeson. The film can be broadly categorized into 3 acts - the first in which Balian searches for his identity and new life in Jerusalem, the second in which the focus is on religion and politics of the time, and the last, the spectacular siege and war.\n\nBloom puts up a commendable performance, so to his detractors out there, you\'re in for a big surprise. Edward Norton had the difficult task of acting through a mask as leper King Baldwin, and I applaud Ridley\'s decision of casting real Muslim actors to learn from them.\n\nFans of Eva Green might be disappointed that the relationship between Balian and Queen Sibylla was played down to focus on the battles, but I feel it\'s a fair trade off.\n\nFirstly, some of you might not like the quick-cut-MTV style editing in Gladiator\'s fight scenes, especially the close ups. This is repeated here though, in a blood splattering manner. The pan-out and general landscape sweeps are mindblowing, and will leave you wanting more. Think about the battles that you see Lord of The Rings Two Towers and Return of the King - the siege on Helm\'s Deep and Minas Tirith - Kingdom of Heaven delivers the equivalent, probably even better (without the fantasy elements). This is one medieval war movie whose battles will stick in your mind for some time.\n\nThe audience were the only disappointing experience for me - they were laughing at a dialogue near the end, where a \"knight\" asked who Balian was, and he answered \"I\'m the blacksmith\", in which the \"knight\" answered \"I\'m the King\". Laughter was abound in the theatre. I was like, HELL-O people! See that lion motif on his armour? That\'s Richard the Lionheart! D\'uh! The Crusades didn\'t end there, it waged on...\n\nWhat is Jerusalem worth? Nothing, everything. Watch this, and in my opinion, it has Oscar written all over it.

They ALSO added some additional footage to the film after making those changes. This version of the film feels darker and less funny to me personally so I prefer the theatrical cut over it.\n\nONCE UPON A DEADPOOL/PG13 - This is the edition that nobody asked for and is the most unnecessary. From an editing standpoint this version of film is very sloppy, and seems like one giant montage. They don\'t even start this version of the film out at the beginning it jumps right into the \"safe room scene\". A lot of the footage included in this edition was already available on the home releases and online (apart from the short amount filmed with Fred Savage).

I guess it\'s because he\'s just a bit kinkier with his sometimes vulgar sense of humor. That\'s something you will never see in the other Marvel or DC Comics movies. Deadpool doesn\'t fit in that family package as his constant humor is just above the edge. I\'m normally not a huge fan of Ryan Reynolds either but I have to admit that his Deadpool character fits him as a glove. About the story it\'s a typical superhero against evil like all other superhero movies but that little humorous touch makes all the difference.

Compared to Deadpool, Deadpool 2 seems more comfortable handling the elements that made the original a success. The humor is bolder and more self-aware because the audience is already familiar with the characters. Ryan Reynolds masters the tricky balance between heavy emotion and outrageous wisecracks because the audience is trained to expect a joke for every heartfelt scene, and the movie gladly obliges. Every trick in the book is used to evoke emotional responses, but the winks to the audience make such manipulation acceptable, even welcome. For those worried that Deadpool 2 is more of the same, they needn\'t fret. The movie introduces a handful of new characters, each well-acted and funny in their own way. There are also some celebrity cameos sprinkled in. Sure, some of them are there solely to make a joke or two, but a couple of the new characters clearly places in future movies. Compared to some superhero movies, Deadpool 2 has a streamlined narrative and pulls off a highly successful third act. The climax of the movie not only avoids the Marvel \"villain problem,\" but it\'s also packed with great action, hilarious jokes, and solid character moments. This success overshadows some plot inconsistencies in the first and second act, which are minor but might bother some hypercritical audience members. Despite Deadpool 2\'s undeniable strengths, two features hold it back slightly. First, the subject of death is handled with such inconsistency that it seems jarring. One character\'s death is an unspeakable tragedy, while another\'s is just a comic bit. The movie missed an opportunity to make fun of the careless treatment of civilian deaths in comic-book movies, but instead fell into the trope. Deadpool 2 also tried to make a progressive commentary on diversity in superhero films, but its minority characters did not have particularly strong roles. Thus, this commentary seemed a bit undeserved and out-of-place. For fans of the original Deadpool, the sequel will not disappoint. The movie capitalizes on what it did well in the first movie and the result is a riotously entertaining, surprisingly emotional, and satisfying second installment.'),(1565,91,'8/10','Worthy sequel','dieseldemon85','30 May 2021','This one was just as enjoyable as the first.

When I heard about an apocalyptic monster movie with Nick Cage as the lead, I was really hyped because he has been part of some amazing projects in the last couple of years and this sounded like something right up my alley. Sadly his character is a little bit underused but Jaeden Martell and Maxwell Jenkins do a great job as his two teenage sons and the overall acting from everyone was solid and convincing. The movie overall felt really similar to A Quiet Place and I\'m pretty sure that some inspiration was taken from there. That is not necessarily a bad thing but if you would compare these two, then Arcadian is nowhere close to the quality of those movies. But that doesn\'t mean that it is not entertaining because I had a pretty good time watching it and I think the creatures from this movie were pretty interesting in their own weird way. They come out at night and have a unique unsettling look to them and are equipped with some surprising abilities and attacks. Sadly we don\'t get to see those that much because in every action scene where the creatures attack, the camera is being shaken non-stop. This made the attack scenes confusing and less suspenseful. I would have loved to see a more detailed look whenever the creatures were on screen but that is really not the case.

It works on so many different levels, and it\'s really quite something because I just got done watching Godzilla vs Kong, and oh boy is there such a stark difference in screenplay quality between the two films.\n\nAll while watching War For The Planet of the Apes I was thinking to myself \"Why couldn\'t the Transformers get this sort of on-screen characterization and treatment?\" The Hollywood excuse is always \"No one wants to see robots fighting for two hours!\" and yet that\'s always the best and only parts worth watching when it comes to the Transformer films.\n\nHere, however, director Matt Reeves flipped the script (I suppose you could say literally) by putting the focus on the CGI apes instead of the humans. The entire story is about Caesar -- everyone else plays second fiddle to Caesar.\n\nIt basically proves that you can make a quality, character-driven film without tacking on some ridiculous human sub-plots just to pad out the time or tie together action scenes.\n\nIn this particular case War For The Planet Of The Apes is probably misnomer given that this is not an action film. Yes, there are action scenes, but this is all character drama, with a few action set pieces to payoff the trilogy.\n\nI thought the original Dawn of the Planet Of The Apes was an okay film, nothing too memorable. I didn\'t care all that much for Rise of the Planet of the Apes. However, I have to say that I adore War For The Planet Of The Apes.\n\nThe difference boils down to bringing the emotion out of the leads (who are all CGI apes), giving the main antagonist a complex and multi-dimensional approach to his self-proclaimed \"purpose\" and a few twists you likely won\'t see coming.\n\nI can understand why a lot of people may not like the film because it\'s methodically filmed and paced. This isn\'t The Fast & The Furious, and if you go in expecting more \"War\" rather than \"Planet of the Apes\" then I suppose you\'ll be sorely disappointed.\n\nHowever, if you\'re looking for a movie that\'s actually really well directed, better written than it has any reason to be, and a lot more emotionally driven than most other Oscar-bait dramas, then you\'ll definitely enjoy War For The Planet Of The Apes.\n\nAnd it still irks me that Serkis wasn\'t even nominated for an Oscar for his performance.

As Caesar and his apes : gorilla , chimpanzee and orangutan , are forced into a deadly conflict with an army of humans led by a ruthless Colonel . Along the way the apes suffer unimaginable losses and Caesar (Andy Serkis), a Chimpanzee raised like a child by the drug\'s creator (first outing with Will Rodman: James Franco) . Here Caesar wrestles with his darker instincts and starts his own mythic quest to avenge his kind that is being submitted in slavery and apartheid . Later on , Caesar is locked and seeking justice for his fellow primates , as they carry out a riot in which simians turn the tables . As simians , Chimpanzees , gorillas uprising violently every human in sight . As the journey finally brings them face to face, Caesar and the Colonel (Woody Harrelson) are pitted against each other in an impressive battle that will determine the fate of both their species and the future of the planet.\n\nThis awesome film is a brilliant and intelligent sequel that contains fights , thrills , frenetic action , go riding , violence , breathtaking scenes and a strong denounce about animal mistreat . Dramatic as well as spectacular film in which simians undergo a rebellion against humans and winding up at a climatic final . Recent sequel in the series based on Pierre Boulle novel initiated by the mythical film ¨Planet of Apes¨ (1968) by Franklyn J. Schaffner that at time of its release regarded as the most extraordinary Scifi in years . It deals with a Chimpanzee hero called Caesar well played by Andy Serkis , this is the third film in which Andy Serkis plays an ape, having previously portrayed 2005\'s version of King Kong and he was also the motion capture actor for Gollum in Lord of the Rings . Highlights of the movie are the spectacular ending scenes when happens a fierce confrontation between a human army and the simians commanded by Caesar . As Caesar leads an animal revolt against his human captors and mankind in which humans battle the apes led by the intelligent ape . The flick plenty of metaphysical significance with thoughtful reflexion about vengeance , apartheid , upon origin of human being , racism , and mistreating ; though also packs action , adventures , intrigue and entertainment . Being mostly a decent follow-up of the former stories , with big moments of energy remaining throughout and it results to be , particularly , a breathtaking Sci-Fi movie full of frantic action , battles, suspense and top-notch FX by Oscarized team who made Avatar and Lord of the Rins . The performers , particularly Andy Serks and Woody Harrelson are pretty good , the characters are well drawn and in spite of excessive computer generator frames all of them are still oddly convincing . Although several elements of the screenplay strain credibility to the limit the story turns out to be pretty interesting and amusing . This film is considered to be the third live action film to have its main hero as a thoughtful, feeling , self aware animal . Andy Serkis\'s distinctive features prove to be recognisable even under ¨Motion Capture¨ FX images . One of the first feature films to use motion-capture in a so-called \'on location\' setting , formerly , motion-capture was limited to special studio set up with special ¨motion-capture¨ cameras in very clearly defined surroundings . Similar the previous films, this is an Apes movie to have CGI apes and with arm extensions . Remaining cast formed by Gorilla , Chimpanzees , Orangutans and other apes are nice , in spite of overlong scenes in Motion Capture they are still nicely and compellingly made . Writing credits by Rick Jaffa & Amanda Silver , along with Mark Bomback and Matt Reeves himself , their screenplay is just clever and including interesting issues about human being and animals . One of the important attributes of this work, is the magnificent and luminous cinematography by Michael Seresin . Epic as well as emotive musical score by Michael Giacchino , it\'s full of fury and sound . Motion picture was well directed by Matt Reeves (Dawn of the Planet of the Apes , Let me in , Cloverfield)\n\nOther adaptations based on the characters created by Pierre Boulle are as follows : The original and the best is ¨Planet of Apes¨ by Franklyn J. Schaffner with Charlton Heston , Roddy MacDowall, Kim Hunter , followed by \"Beneath the Planet of the Apes\" (1970) with James Franciscus , Linda Harrison , Maurice Evans ; it\'s followed by three inferior sequels : Escape from the planet of apes , Conquest for battle of Apes and Battle for Planet of Apes. A reboot Planet of Apes 2011 by Tim Burton . And new remakes : Rise of the planet of Apes 2011, and Dawn of the Planet of Apes (2014) .'),(1591,93,'9/10','Absolutely epic movie and trilogy.','IamNiyatiJoshi','27 May 2019','War (as arguably miss-titled as it is) is once again on top of its game, with a more intense story, the effects looking better than ever, some genuine surprises and shocking moments, and the A-game acting.

It\'s not as well executed or as well structured as \'Dawn\', but it\'s an excellent film nonetheless and builds upon an already rich mythology that offers up an elaborate explanation as to how Charlton Heston came back from space to find himself on a damn monkey planet.\n\nMatt Reeves returns for directing duties and recaptures the same foreboding and tension he evoked the last time around. This is a very downbeat and bleak movie, so much so I actually had to remind myself that this is a summer blockbuster produced and released by 20th Century Fox. It\'s incredible to think that something as dark as this can still sneak under the wire and into the mainstream, and we should all be thankful of that fact. Andy Serkis has graduated across the series from being the plot device of \'Rise\', to the dual protagonist of \'Dawn\', to the full-on lead character of \'War\', and his motion captured performance is truly remarkable. You can even tell it\'s his face at certain points - a sneer here, a frown there - and I fully believe this performance should qualify him for an Academy Award nomination for Lead Actor. He\'s the crown jewel of this franchise and he leads the charge from beginning to end this time around. I also have to make room for Steve Zahn\'s performance as a newly introduced ape, who is about the closest thing to a comic relief this film gets and his comic timing and tender eccentricity allows some breathing room between all the doom and gloom. The crowning achievement of this trilogy is its ability to seamlessly blend technological craft with human artistry. I have always favoured practical effects over CGI, but my god, even I can\'t deny just how magnificent the visual effects are. This is as close to photo- real you will see.\n\nThe title of the film is somewhat of a mislead since it\'s a much smaller and more intimate story this time around, and I feel there was more of an epic war taking place in \'Dawn\'. This is much more of a revenge tale, framed through the eyes of our protagonist Caesar, who we have seen grow up and mature into a leader across the two previous films, which lends a greater sense of dimension and complexity to his character. Watching him and his clan strike back against the remnants of the human race becomes an interesting exercise for us. As human beings we are naturally predisposed to the survival of our species, even in fiction, and usually films set in a post-apocalyptic world tend to lean heavily towards that as the goal. The \'Apes\' films ask us to do something else - they ask us to root AGAINST the human race, and that does create a conflict within us as viewers. Not all humans are bad, and we know where this story is taking us once you factor in \'Planet of the Apes\' 1968, yet at the same time these apes are every bit as complex and fallible and heroic and dangerous as we are. They have an equal right to live and build a future together. And while this film definitely comes down on the side of the apes, unlike \'Dawn\' which showed the failings of both sides to make peace, it is a strange experience rooting for them to win this time around since there are no real human allies like James Franco or Jason Clarke\'s characters. In any other film, the apes would be the villains and Woody Harrelson\'s Colonel character makes a good case as to why he sees it that way, even though the filmmakers jettison his humanity in order to paint him as a more out-and-out villain. After all, we, the audience, have to be on side come the finale, especially come the arrival of an unexpected deus ex machina.\n\nThis has been an intelligent and emotionally and morally complex series of films that have raised interesting questions about animal rights, speciesism, societal hierarchies, leadership and subservience, communication, conflict and peace. They are not simply mindless sci- fi movies cashing in on an existing property. Both of the previous films have been deeply thoughtful explorations of those aforementioned themes and ideas. So I am very pleased to report that \'War for the Planet of the Apes\' proudly carries that torch all the way through to its beautifully biblical final moments.'),(1594,93,'10/10','As near a perfect film as you\'ll get.','Pgle05','4 September 2022','War for the Planet of the Apes is as near a perfect film as you\'ll ever get.

Woody Harrelson plays a great villain and is owner of the one and only expositional scene in the film. It truly is a masterpiece and caps off the trilogy like I never thought possible.

Rise of the Planet of the Apes, the first installment, was a masterful piece of art. It mainly focused on two characters, Caesar, the protagonist of this movie, and his \'keeper\'/friend. It was very detailed, focussing on the relationship between the two and all that fit well with how the narrative unfolded. The second installment had a similar formula of keeping the story detailed and it worked well for it was well.\n\nThat\'s why I had a lot of hope for this movie. Unfortunately, that very formula that made me love the previous parts, just doesn\'t work with this one. War of the Planet of the Apes starts out just fine, but then, just in a few minutes, the story slows down a lot: each scene is very detailed, trying to give its viewers a feel of its characters. The thing is, we already know about many characters from its previous parts, so we\'re not that interested about that any more. Many apes haven\'t developed speech, so most of the movie is in sign language. While it is \'realistic\' and I give plaudits to the makers for this, it adds to the slowness of the movie, making it boring, as one just can\'t understand what\'s going on. On top of all that, the movie is quite predictable. Add up all these factors and the fact that the movie runs for more than 2 hours, it becomes slightly difficult to watch. I literally had to fast forward a few scenes because I just wanted the movie to end.\n\nAll that said, the movie does have its positives. The CGI is amazing and the apes really look as if they exist. The movie might be boring, but it is still a good piece of art in terms of story-telling and one can tell a lot of effort went into it.\\\n\nRecommendation: don\'t watch it if you can\'t stand slow movies and don\'t have your hopes up based on the previous two installments'),(1597,93,'10/10','Ignore the ignorant','conroyart-46646','5 April 2020','Don\'t normally review.

And this is about Caeser going on a journey to stop a war between his apes and an army of highly trained soldiers, while he also tries to control his more violent instincts.\n\nFirst the obvious, the CGI is amazing and is truly a technological marvel to cinema. Andy Serkis once again plays the ape ruler Caesar and is easily the best movie character in recent years, in each film he has gotten progressively better and in this one it is definitely the best performance. The story is great and is well acted throughout. This movie is also an amazing drama. There are a lot of moments that just make you jerk a tear every once in a while and its believable. The action sequences are pretty good too. Woody Harrelson plays the colonel and he does a pretty good job at it (He is not as good as koba but still good). He is just a character that you can relate to and you understand why he is doing all of this. Caesar and the colonel are pretty relatable. As much as i would love to say how great this movie is, i better stop right here.\n\nI loved every part of this movie and i did not find anything i did not like about it, but i am gonna talk about why i think most people were disappointed with this film. So if you watched all the trailers and looked at the title you may be expecting one thing, a ton of apes and humans fighting with guns and rockets. But although there is some of that in this movie, its definitely not the main point of it. This movie to its core is about the war that a person faces emotionally while war is happening around him. We see this concept with Caesar all the way through the movie.\n\nIt also talks about what terrible things a person or people would do in a war. Woody Harrelson\'s character does what he does because he believes that the entire human race is going to go extinct if he does not act. I mean, would you do that if you knew that you could slowly be replaced by another species?\n\nSo some people do not like this film because they were expecting a full on hardcore war movie. And it is that, but it really is a commentary about how a person has a war within themselves when war is happening around them. And people either missed, did not care, or did not understand the more darker themes about this movie.\n\nBut anyway, in the end i thought this movie was a masterpiece in every way it could have been. It has amazing CGI, performances, action sequences, dark themes, tear jerking moments, and a beautiful moral to it.

I like the darkness but there are some issues with the story. I don\'t buy any reason for Caesar to leave behind his tribe. It could only be revenge and I don\'t like it. I don\'t buy all the ape prisoners either. It seems more likely that most if not all of them would be murdered by the soldiers. I don\'t see them taking prisoners. When the enemy soldiers arrived in front of the compound, there was one moment of greatness that almost came to being. I wish that the enemy army is made up of apes.

Clearly, any attempt to remake a concept that failed first time around is fraught with danger, but an attempt to remake a classic runs the risk that one\'s film will be unfavourably compared with the original. The original 1968 film of \'Planet of the Apes\' is one of cinema\'s great science fiction classics. More than an adventure story, it touches on some of the concerns of the late sixties- the fear of nuclear war, race relations- and also raises more fundamental issues about the relationship between man and nature, the relationship between religion and science, Darwinism and animal rights. It was therefore a brave move on Tim Burton\'s part to try and remake it.\n\nThe main concept of Tim Burton\'s film is basically similar to Franklin Schaffner\'s. An astronaut from Earth travels to a planet ruled by intelligent apes. Humans exist on this planet, but they are regarded as an inferior species, despised and exploited by the apes. There is, however, an important difference. In the original film, the apes are the only intelligent and articulate beings on the planet. Although they have only attained a pre-industrial level of civilization (they have firearms, but no power-driven machinery, and no means of transport other than the horse or horse-drawn vehicles), they are a far more advanced species than the planet\'s human inhabitants, who lack the powers of speech and reason and live an animal-like existence. In Burton\'s remake, humans and apes have similar powers of speech and intellect; it is only the apes\' greater physical strength that enables them to dominate the planet and to treat the humans as slaves.\n\nIt was this ironic role-reversal, with apes behaving like men and men behaving like beasts, that gave Schaffner\'s film its satirical power. That film was advertised with the slogan \'Somewhere in the Universe, there must be something better than man!\', and the apes are indeed, in some respects, better than man. Their law against killing others of their kind, for example, is much more strictly observed than our commandment that \'Thou shalt do no murder\'. There is no sense that the apes are bad and the humans good. Even Dr Zaius, the orang-utan politician, is not a wicked individual; by the standards of his society he is an honourable and decent one. His weakness is that of excessive intellectual conservatism and unwillingness to accept opinions that do not fit in with his preconceived world view. (In this respect the apes are very human indeed).\n\nBurton\'s film takes a less subtle moral line. It is a straightforward story of a fight for freedom. The villains are most of the apes, especially the fanatical, human-hating General Thade. The heroes are Captain Davidson, the astronaut from Earth, the planet\'s human population who long for freedom from the domination of the apes, and a few liberal, pro-human apes, especially Ari, the daughter of an ape senator. The apes are more aggressive and more obviously animals than in the original film; they still frequently move on all fours and emit fierce shrieks whenever angry or excited.\n\nThere are some things about this film that are good, especially the ape make-up which is, for the most part, more convincing than in the original film and allows the actors more scope to show emotion. (I say \'for the most part\' because Ari looks far less simian than do most of the other apes- Tim Burton obviously felt that the audience would be more likely to accept her as a sympathetic character if she looked half-human). The actors playing apes actually seem more convincing than those playing humans. Tim Roth is good as the militaristic Thade, as is Helena Bonham-Carter as Ari. Mark Wahlberg, on the other hand, is not an actor of the same caliber as Charlton Heston, who played the equivalent role in the original film, and Estella Warren has little to do other than look glamorous. (Heston has a cameo role as an ape in Burton\'s film, and even gets to repeat his famous line \'Damn you all to hell\').\n\nOverall, however, the film is a disappointment when compared to the original, a simple science-fiction adventure story as opposed to an intelligent and philosophical look at complex issues. It tried to copy the device of a surprise ending but failed. Schaffner\'s famous final twist is shocking, but makes perfect sense in the context of what has gone before. Burton\'s makes no sense whatsoever.\n\nTim Burton can be a director of great originality, but with \'Planet of the Apes\' he fell into the standard Hollywood trap of trying to copy what had already been done and remaking a film that never needed to be remade. It was good to see him return to form with the brilliant \'Big Fish\', one of the best films of last year. 6/10'),(1606,94,'7/10','Underrated','on_the_can','6 April 2011','In the spring of 2001 audiences seemed eager to see Tim Burton\'s retelling of the 1968 classic, \"Planet of the Apes.\" By the summer of 2001 it seemed to be the movie everybody loved to hate. Were the criticisms fair? Not if you ask me.\n\n2001\'s Planet of the Apes\' biggest downfall, in my opinion, is unfortunately also it\'s biggest strength. Unlike many remakes which often end up as nothing more than weaker rehashes of their predecessor\'s this version of \'Apes\' dared to be different. The plot has been stripped down to its bare bones and then rebuilt into something completely new. This is refreshing, if you ask me. Especially when rewatching it now, because just a few short years after this film came out we launched into sort of a remake renaissance, where half the tent pole films that come out every year are the same lesser rehashes that I spoke of a second ago. This film does take a moment here and there to wink at the \'68 original, but Burton and his merry band of screenwriters has created a world completely original...it could be watched next to any entry of that original series as a wholey different film.\n\nThis is also the film\'s biggest flaw though, or at least financially speaking, because the original \'Apes\' franchise has a cult following behind it that could almost rival that of Star Wars or Star Trek. The core audience for this film really only wanted to see their favourite story told with modern day effects and makeup. I don\'t think we needed that, but I\'m not sure how many would agree with me.\n\nNow, if you want to compare the two films plots and decide which one is stronger that\'s a whole other debate. But I don\'t think that\'s fair, that\'s why I champion it for taking such a different approach. I don\'t think this movie should be compared to any other movie and with that mindset a much better appreciation can be found. To put it bluntly, this movie ain\'t bad...in fact it\'s actually pretty good.\n\nI won\'t deconstruct the plot for you...if you\'re interested enough to be reading this you probably at least know the jist of it anyway. But it\'s a solid and interesting plot that sets up a very fun and entertaining action adventure flick. Visually its in many ways a departure from typical Burton fair but his stamp is definitely evident in its art direction, and the atmosphere he creates in this jungle/desert/urban/high tech universe is really something to behold. The apes are not only impressive in terms of makeup but they are also creatively impressive from the choices of the species to match personalities, the incredible costumes and simply perfect performances by a cast who act through all that latex. And while I\'m praising I\'ll also throw up a shout out for Danny Elfman\'s great score, which just might be one of his best.\n\nThe only caveat I\'ll lay on the movie is that the twist ending, obviously conceived to rival the famous twist of the original, kind of falls flat. BUT...considering how many instalments the original franchise had I have no doubt that the producers had hoped to make a sequel had this film been more financially successful, and had that sequel been made maybe we would\'ve learned the story behind this twist and all would\'ve been forgiven.\n\nIt\'s a little too late to say, \'long story short,\' but I will anyway. Give this movie a fair shot. It may not be without its flaws but how many movies are? Try not to compare it to the original, just watch it with a bowl of popcorn and have fun.'),(1607,94,'6/10','Escape from the Boulle planet.','dbdumonteil','29 August 2001','Visually,this film is sometimes a splendor;the light falls on a crepuscular world.The Apes\' town is quite scary particularly when you see it from a distance ,as it stands out against an ominous sky.In the very beginning,the cast and credits are also successful,with an adequate martial music.The first third has some funny,parodic and sometimes politically incorrect lines.In the second third,the movie begins to lose steam,although the discovery in the wrecked spaceship is a rather good idea.

Tim Roth is effective as well,but his part is less so.David Warner and Kris Kristofferson are wasted.As a tribute to Shaffner(?)both Linda Harrison (an unidentified woman captured with Leo) and Charlton Heston (moaning his curse,which is,admittedly,funny)appear unbilled.\n\nTim Burton might be a director to remember.Although he has not made a genuine masterpiece yet,his filmography is already rich:\"Sleepy hollow\",\"Edward Scissorhands ,the marvelous \"Ed Wood\" (Martin Landau is unforgettable).But redoing \"planet of the apes \" was a hard task.Shaffner\'s movie followed a progression,it moved slowly,from the long introduction showing the three astronauts making their way across desolate landscapes to the stunning final shots with Heston and Harrison \'s roaming down by the sea.Remember how long it took Taylor to convince Zira he was a thinking man!Here it seems natural to Ari almost as soon as she sees him,that Leo is no dumb idiot animal.And that\'s the last straw,even Tim Roth (some kind of cross between Shaffner\'s Cornelius and a pulp fiction baddie)pretty damn quickly believes too that that human is too clever for his own sake.\n\nTim Burton\'s so-so remake epitomizes the dearth of good scripts.Pierre Boulle\'s book is a golden mine and one could have written a coherent story out of it,different from that of the first version.Why not,for instance,introduce the two \"astronauts\" whose scenes open and close it,and turn Leo\'s adventures into a flashback?What about showing the love between the hero and the woman-animal ?And the son they had?And the menace this son represented for the simian race? All these ideas were left over by Shaffner\'s script writers and could have built a strong new tale.\n\nThe main flaw lies in the human beings:here,they speak -English!- ,they can reason,they can swim (!),they are (except for bubble head Warren)clever,so why the hell did the apes tame them?'),(1608,94,'seemore-3','As shallow as the water he crashlands in.','21 August 2001','Was this review helpful?

Neither Mark Wahlberg\'s character nor the tension is ever developed, so when he is confronted by the apes: we feel nothing.\n\nThe humans, though they have the benefit of increased intelligence and speech, are poorly utilized. And Kris Kristofferson is criminally wasted.\n\nThe make-up and effects are, as you would expect, fantastic. However, despite improved flexibility in the make-up, there is little warmth in either the performances or direction that made millions of kids go ape-nuts in the seventies.

Yet another movie classic utterly ruined by a cheap, shallow, effect-heavy and redundant remake. The original \"Planet of the Apes\" was an intelligent and thought-provoking movie with a very clear message. It was a movie that focused almost entirely on dialogue, which sounds very dull but was in fact very interesting.\n\nThis movie, on the other hand, seems to have done away with pretty much ALL the dialogues. Instead of a great movie we get an incredibly stupid two hour chase movie. Dialogue has been reduced to a mere minimum, character interaction and development are non-existent and most of the time it\'s extremely hard to figure out what\'s going on. Instead, we get a bunch of pointless action scenes, some marginally funny one-liners and some very hollow quasi-intelligent conversations.\n\nThe only thing worth mentioning about this movie is that it looks absolutely fantastic. The make-up of the apes is magnificent, and the sets and backgrounds are beautiful too. However, this does not distract from the fact that \"Planet of the Apes (2001)\" is a very shallow and simplistic movie, filled with paper-thin characters, stupid dialogue and a nearly non-existent plot.

The original Planet of the Apes (POTA) opened the door to this new world and made it interesting and believable.\n\nThis movie is very different than the original. About halfway though, it is clear this movie is going in a different direction. Basically, a astronaut crash lands on planet populated by apes (the dominant species) and humans (the ones who exist in the wild, and as slaves). Soon after he is captured, he picks up the homing beacon to a rescue ship... and the story progresses from there.\n\nThat\'s a pretty great setup, and the story progresses in a totally different direction than the original. I really appreciated that because it made the movie all the more interesting.\n\nThe special effects were one of the big treats of this movie. Not only do we get scenes with the spacecraft, space station, etc. at the beginning (unlike the original), but the character makeup of the apes was fantastic. The variety of body builds, faces, personalities, etc. was very entertaining to watch. Somehow they made Helena Bonham Carter look \"sexy\" as a young animal rights activist/chimpanzee... and Tim Roth look more threatening and aggressive than just about any character I\'ve seen in the movies. Brilliant work.\n\nThe ape habitats were also kind of cool. If you want to know what an ape kitchen, dining room, bedroom, etc. looks like, you\'ll get a peek in side some of them in this movie.\n\nAll the thematic hallmarks of the original are present (role-reversal, overt prejudice and cruelty, fight for equal-rights). While they are probably not as impactive as they were given how times have change, they still deliver a sting about who unpleasant such a society is.\n\nWhile I wouldn\'t say this is as strong a movie as the original, it is still a fun movie see and worth checking out.'),(1615,94,'7/10','Didn\'t Live Up To The Apes Legacy','Swampthing','14 August 2001','Burton took the great 1968 heady drama and simply turned it into an action pic with tons of makeup, and I have the impression he missed the whole point of POTA. It wasn\'t supposed to be an action-packed tour de force, but rather a thinking man\'s film. What happened to the debates about man\'s role in this society? What about the science and experiments conducted on man in the older movie? I had other problems with the film too: Helena Bonham Carter seemed too overly obsessed with this human too quickly and for no reason. Where the heck was Cornelius anyway? So why did I give it a 7? The makeup was truly fantastic, and the action choreographed well. As a standalone movie, it would have been alright, but unfortunately, it has a legacy to live up to. The second reason for the high score was the sexy, sensuous presence of Estella Warren. It seems she was cheated out of a role here; why didn\'t she become romantically involved with him?\n\nWhat was her backstory?

Sign in to vote.','Tim Burton\'s new \"Planet of the Apes\" is actually a remake--excuse me, a \"re-imagining\"--of the first TWO movies of the old series. Its occasional paraphrasing of lines from the original movie (devoid of any meaningful context), and its cameos by members of the original cast (Charlton Heston and Linda Harrison), only underscore that this new version isn\'t what the original was, i.e., an original. Mark Wahlberg, as Our Hero, has none of the cynical, edgy complexity of Heston\'s Taylor, and is in fact the sort of can-do flyboy Taylor found laughable. Much as I adore Helena Bonham Carter, her turn as Ari, a sultry, sexy, meddling, annoying human-rights activist, is ultimately tiresome, and absolutely incomparable to Kim Hunter\'s brave, brilliant, impish Zira of the old series. The role is also a criminal waste of Bonham Carter\'s beauty, hidden as it is behind a bizarre makeup that looks neither ape nor human. Rick Baker\'s highly-touted ape makeups (which I\'ve enjoyed since the days of \"Schlock\" and \"Kentucky Fried Movie\") are highly uneven here. Tim Roth\'s villainous Thade has the best, with most of the rest being just adequate and no particular improvement over John Chambers\' work in the original. And the socko ending (keep reading; I won\'t spoil it for you) is simply tacked on: unlike the jolting end of the original, it neither ties together nor arises from the movie\'s earlier action in a way that Explains Everything. Instead, it begs so many questions (mainly \"How the heck did THAT happen?\") that it seems engineered (or contrived) solely to set the stage for more sequels. All told, this is \"Apes Lite,\" a comic-bookish caricature of the original, made for the short-attention-span crowd. It made me want to do something I hadn\'t done in ages: fire up the VCR and roll the original again. It\'s typical of the 1968 movie\'s gritty, clever irony that the first word of dialogue uttered by an ape--his entire line, in fact--is \"Smile.\"'),(1617,94,'6/10','Tim Burton and the Apes','jhclues','4 August 2001','After the original film of the same title and it\'s numerous sequels, you have to ask the question, did the world really need another version? Even with the advancements in technology and special effects since Charlton Heston first landed on the planet, it\'s kind of like an aging actor getting yet another face-lift; it looks good but it just can\'t recapture that original beauty, no matter how good the surgeon is. And `Planet of the Apes\' couldn\'t have had a better man to hold the scalpel, but even director Tim Burton couldn\'t make this one any more than what it is, an imaginative adventure story that basically just puts a new face on something tried and true. It looks great, and the atmosphere Burton created fairly crackles; but as a story, we\'ve been there, done that, and even with a slightly different twist at the end, this one simply does not have much to add, with the exception that the apes really look good. But does being able to showcase make-up and F/X wizards justify resurrecting this one? I guess the bottom line is, this movie\'s going to make a killing at the box office.\n\nIt all begins on a space station where some highly advanced chimps are being trained to go into space and do amazing things. One of those in charge of these wannabe astronauts is Leo Davidson (Mark Wahlberg), and when his special ward, Pericles, is launched and lost in a huge electrical storm, Leo jumps into a space capsule and takes it upon himself to go where no man has gone before. He quickly gets swallowed up by the storm himself, and after some exceptionally good visual effects, he not only gets spewed out onto an unknown planet, but he\'s some four to five hundred years into the future. He emerges from his landing with nary a scratch, but after barely having enough time to catch his breath or get his bearings, he finds himself caught up in the middle of some kind of hunt, and the prey happens to be humans. And it\'s then, of course, that he discovers that something is terribly wrong here. Apes are the hunters, and they seem to be in charge of everything. He readily discerns that there doesn\'t seem to be much percentage in attempting a parley at this juncture, intelligent as the marauding primates appear to be, so he opts for that which is often the better part of valor: He runs. And the adventure begins in earnest.\n\nIf this movie had to be made (which obviously, it did) at least the right man ended up in the director\'s chair, because Burton has a way creating a look and a mood that suits this kind of material perfectly, just as he did with `Batman,\' `Sleepy Hollow\' and `Edward Scissorhands\' (just to name a few). But there just isn\'t that much story here. It\'s an incredible journey, to be sure, but it\'s just not fresh enough to maintain interest for very long, even as good as it looks and exciting as it gets. And, whereas the original had something of a message about the miasmatic direction society was headed, about the only message here is the one that can be found in the `Cha-ching!\' of the cash register.\n\nAs the hero of the tale, Wahlberg comports himself well enough, but in all fairness, this wasn\'t a role that required much emoting. Basically, if he could run well and look alternately confused and determined, the part was his. He did and it was. And to his credit, he did it very well. Character development was unnecessary for the purposes of this film, so with Leo, what you see is what you get. No surprises, and you never really get to know much about who this guy is or what makes him tick-- but it doesn\'t make any difference. He\'s the hero, he cares about his chimp, and that\'s all you have to know.\n\nHelena Bonham Carter does a terrific job as Ari, the Ape who champions the cause of the humans, in whom she sees a value beyond the level of degradation to which her peers have consigned them. Of all of those in the cast, she actually manages to do some acting, and she does it exceptionally well, expressing herself much better than what anyone would have the right to expect here, especially taking the cumbersome make-up into consideration. You cannot help, however, getting a sense that this is what it would have been like had Merchant/Ivory made `Gorillas In the Mist.\'\n\nAs General Thade, the ruthless military leader of the apes, Tim Roth adds a villain to his resume that is quite unlike any he\'s played before and, like Bonham Carter, actually gives a remarkable and agile performance, all things considered.\n\nThe supporting cast includes Michael Clarke Duncan (Attar), Kris Kristofferson (Karubi), Estella Warren (Daena), Paul Giamatti (providing some comic relief as Limbo, the slave trader),Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa (Krull) and features a clever cameo by Charlton Heston. Taken at face value for the action/adventure film it is, `Planet of the Apes\' is entertaining, but lacks the substance of the original and may be disappointing to anyone hoping for anything more than a visually engaging foray into a kind of twilight zone of the new millennium. For what it is, it\'s well made and delivered; it just seems that the talent involved with this project could have been better served elsewhere.

The thing is this remake(or re-imagining if you like) is not, in fact this could very well be Burton\'s worst movie, even worse than Charlie and the Chocolate Factory and that could have been much better. Tim Burton, what has happened to you? Before I get to the many negatives of this film, I will say the apes are very well done. Their mannerisms and the way they move are perfectly convincing. Plus Danny Elfman\'s score was pretty good, it\'s no Edward Scissorhands or Big Fish but it\'s good enough. And the scenery and special effects are fantastic.\n\nHowever, that is all the praise I can give it. I am briefly going to say it is vastly inferior to the 1968 classic, which was much more exciting and much better written as well. The script is awful, not quite Pearl Harbor kind-of-awful, but some of it is lame and unintentionally cheesy. The story takes a while to get going and meanders all over the place, not helped by pedestrian pacing and drawn out scenes and very rarely gets interesting. Plus is it me, or does the film get unnecessarily loud at times? Tim Burton\'s direction was also a disappointment, usually his films are full of heart, that\'s what made Edward Scissorhands especially such a gem, but here he seems lost, bogged down might I say. On top of that, the character development is non-existent, as is the chemistry between the actors and the characters are extremely clichéd, especially Kris Kristofferson\'s character. And the acting didn\'t fare that much better, Mark Wahlberg is a bland lead, while Estella Warren acts like a zombie throughout. Then we have Tim Roth trying hard and giving the only credible performance as Thade, and Helena Bonham Carter wasted as sympathetic Ari, while Paul Giamatti is useless. Not even the talented David Warner can save this film. And don\'t get me started on the ending, what a bummer, so predictable and obvious.\n\nOverall, a case of all style no substance. Definitely not Burton\'s finest hour. 3/10 Bethany Cox'),(1621,94,'6/10','A Mixed Bag, but Ultimately a Decent Addition to the Apes Saga','Wuchakk','14 March 2014','YEAR: 2001 DIRECTOR: Tim Burton COUNTRY: USA RUNTIME: 119 minutes\n\nTHE PLOT: An astronaut (Mark Wahlberg) crashlands on a planet ruled by apes where humans are considered animals and slaves, even though they are intelligent and can speak. The astronaut soon leads the humans to revolt.\n\nI don\'t think there\'s any question that Tim Burton really knows how to make a film look great. And so it is with this remake of \"Planet of the Apes.\" The locations, sets, ape make-up, costumes, cast, score (Danny Elfman) and direction are all outstanding. Just as good as the original film and, in many cases, even better. Unfortunately, the overall results are a mixed bag.\n\nWHAT DOESN\'T WORK: The biggest problem with this remake is that there is no build-up of mystery. Wahlberg crashlands to the planet very early on in the story, just like in the original film. Unfortunately, as soon as he lands he\'s IMMEDIATELY thrust into the ape/human conflict, captured and taken to the ape city. This flashes by so quickly that the viewer could easily MISS IT ALL if s/he got up for a few minutes to get something from the kitchen!! The original took its time in this matter; Taylor (Heston) and his fellow astronauts obviously crashland in the middle of nowhere and explore the planet for a long period of time before eventually encountering the inhabitants of the planet. It\'s all very mysterious, and there\'s a lot of build-up to the ape revelation.\n\nIt\'s also highly unbelievable that Wahlberg would crashland right into the midst of the human/ape conflict. The planet is the size of Earth, so what are the chances that he\'d land right in the middle of the fray? I suppose Burton and the writers didn\'t want the film to bog down once Wahlberg crashlands, but couldn\'t they have at least given us FIVE MINUTES of exploration time, giving the impression that Wahlberg searches for a fairly long period of time before encountering the humans and apes? As it\'s presented it\'s simply too unbelievable.\n\nThis is a major misstep; and because it happens so early in the film it strongly tempts most intelligent viewers (who naturally MUST have some reasonable amount of believability to enjoy sci-fi) to lose faith in the picture and tune out or, at least, become excessively critical of the remainder of the film.\n\nAnother problem with the picture is that I just simply failed to really get caught up in the characters and their story. There needed to be more character-defining dialogue. A well written script causes the viewer to be CAPTIVATED by the storyline. Well, I never fully got captivated.\n\nThese factors explain why I was severely let down when first viewing the film at the theater in 2001.\n\nWHAT WORKS: Seeing the film again recently, I was braced for these flaws and willing to suspend disbelief to (try to) enjoy the story. I now conclude that there are numerous worthwhile qualities to the remake.\n\nFor one thing, although Mark Wahlberg is no Charleton Heston (Taylor was Heston\'s greatest role and performance IMHO), I think he does a great job as the protagonist. Helena Bonham Carter is also fabulous in the Zira-like role of Ari; she really brings Ari to life and makes her unique. And as beautiful as Linda Harrison was as Nova, Estella Warren pretty much blows her out of the water in the counterpart role of Daena. Unfortunately her character is shallow and we never get a satisfyingly good look at Estelle in all her voluptuous glory. But, no matter, what we DO see is breathtaking.\n\nTim Roth is utterly evil as the villainous Thade. This is very much in contrast to Dr. Zaius in the original, who was actually a very noble character. Lastly, the giant Michael Clarke Duncan is magnificent as the gorilla general, Thade\'s \"friend.\"\n\nAs to be expected, the ape make-up is WAY better than the original, even though I still love the job they did in the earlier film. The ape characters don\'t only look more like highly evolved apes compared to the original, they walk, talk, howl, grunt, jump, fight and climb more like real apes.\n\nThe ape city sets are fabulous too, albeit a bit too dark for my tastes. I find this unbelievable and verging on cartooney. I know Burton is into Goth and therefore prefers dark lighting, but it would be nice to actually SEE the wonderful sets made for the film (or perhaps he doesn\'t want the viewer to get too good a look and see how artificial they really are? I don\'t know, I\'m just guessing).\n\nI also liked all the homages to the original film -- the various lines, Linda Harrison, Charleton Heston as Thade\'s dying father, etc.\n\nAlthough numerous people had a problem with the ending, I think they did a good job. How else better to end it? Notice how the camera mysteriously shoots from behind the \"Lincoln Memorial\" just like the original does with the Statue of Liberty.\n\nFINAL ANALYSIS: Despite a couple major flaws there\'s a lot to appreciate in Burton\'s remake. It\'s not as good as the original or \"Beneath,\" but it\'s, at least, on a par with \"Escape.\" And it\'s certainly better than \"Conquest\" and, especially, \"Battle.\"\n\nThe bottom line is that Tim Burton\'s remake of \"Planet of the Apes\" is a worthwhile addition to your apes film collection. For serious \"Apes\" fans it\'s even mandatory because, even though -- OVERALL -- it doesn\'t come close to the greatness of the original (or \"Beneath\"), it has numerous singular aspects that surpass it.\n\nGRADE: C+ or B-'),(1622,94,'1/10','AWFUL!!!','windegg','31 July 2001','\"Why can\'t we all get along?\" the Rodney King ape asks.

But it\'s such a wonder how this movie could be so good with only so few places the movie took place for the first hour. What\'s even better is EEAAO occurred within closed and overcrowded spaces that may slightly trigger people experiencing ADHD, hypersensitivity and claustrophobia, pushing the film into maximum impact.\n\nThis film is filled with action-packed sequences that will blow you brains out! It\'s fun, exhilarating, creative, hilarious and never-been-done-before! Adding up with the out-of-the-world concept and unique storyline, every fighting scene seems appropriately done and even if there\'s just so many styles and tones of scenes coming out from the screen, fitting is the right word to describe them.\n\nEEAAO seems like any other movie at the beginning but when all hell breaks loose, the story becomes increasingly complex as it explains the world revolving around the central character, propelling the plot into motion. Meticulously explained, the narrative manages to be exciting and outrageously wild but reasonable within its own multiverse contexts.\n\nMichelle Yeoh, our Malaysian actress ??????, is excellent in this, proving that she\'s fluid in bringing out the best of her multiple character(s). Complicated as it is, she knew what kind of project she\'s doing and it just shows how dedicated she is at acting. It\'s not easy to play her role and it\'s definitely not easy to create multiple personas interconnected by different universes and dimensions, with separate storylines, all destined to have the same fate. This is an Oscar-worthy performance, and whether or not if Yeoh got nominated lies on the decision if the Oscar recognizes speculative fiction as a genre acceptable to compete with other highly-appraisal films.\n\nThere were many genuinely laugh-out-loud moments throughout, NOT the one where you\'re forced to laugh just because everyone is laughing to avoid the awkwardness surrounding the audience in the hall, but the one that it\'s just funny you\'re having a truly good time. The script and performance help to amplify the comedic moment but the most special thing is that it\'s aware of its VFX effects and the team knows how to level up/down the intensity and realness of the CGI. How so? The CGI is very good, but there are times that the CGI is made to be purposely bad, like you\'re watching a short film by a bunch of ambitious varsity students, and it works! It works because everyone in the theater was laughing, it clicks just right with the moments and scenes you\'re watching. You\'ll laugh at how bad it is in a good way!\n\nIf there\'s one dislike from this film is that it\'s gonna be a tough watch for some people. Like mentioned earlier, those with ADHD and hypersensitivity may be triggered with the intensity of this film. Also, the storyline is difficult for some to digest due to its complexity of its universe-building. The film is promoted as being light and fun but...EEAAO is weighty, dark, bizarre and surreal, only those who have what it takes can appropriately understand the building block storytelling.\n\nVerdict: Mind-bending and mind-blowing, Everything Everywhere All at Once masters its building block storytelling that feels like an acid trip worth experiencing and that experience... can only be felt once in a lifetime. We\'re only in March but without a doubt, this is already the best film of the year!

It contains impressive action, drama, SF, humor as well as numerous incredible scenes and shots. I give him a big plus for his incredible originality and idea. However, for me personally, the film was a little too much, to put it that way. In the context of the Oscars, it\'s also incredible to me that the film picked up so many important awards. Is this the best movie of the year?! Reading numerous reviews and comments, it\'s clear to me that I\'m in the minority and that\'s why I\'m surprised by all the hype surrounding the film. For some, this is even one of the best films ever made. Due to these expectations, I have to admit that the film did not impress me at all. It\'s not a problem for me to admit that it\'s up to me and that I can\'t understand the magnitude of the film, which will obviously be a cult classic tomorrow.

I am 37 years old and have been a movie buff since I was a child. Movies are my passion - classic cinema, international cinema, domestic cinema. I see at least 30+ movies in theaters every year from all counties and compile a top 10 list of my favorite films.\n\nI can count on both hands the number of times I have sat in a movie theater slackjawed and stunned, unable to move as credits rolled on a film. I can count on one hand the number of times this has occurred to not only me but the audience with whom I\'ve watched a movie. I have also only seen a few movies where the audience erupted in applause during the credits - rapturous, earnest, sustained cheering.\n\nLast night\'s screening of Everything, Everywhere falls into the latter category. As credits rolled, no one moved in a sold-out IMAX theater. We all sat and stared at the screen in awe before eventually cheering and clapping.\n\nThis is a special movie, a miracle of a film, the type of lightning-in-a-bottle motion picture that comes along once in a blue moon to blow your mind and annihilate your heart with its boundless, bursting soul, energy, spirit, and creativity.\n\nIn all my movie-watching years, I have never seen anything like it. The closest comparison I can muster is Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind. There are many similarities between both films\' unhinged, creative expression as well as their ultimate message of persistence and living life in spite of seemingly insurmountable odds and the inevitably that all things, both good and bad, will eventually come to a crashing end when the curtains on our lives close.\n\nMichelle Yeoh is remarkable and delivers a knockout performance that will surely garner plenty of awards attention. It\'s hard to imagine many actresses who could have so effortlessly kept step with such a demanding role, but she coasts through drama, comedy, action, and sci-fi with a verve and energy that left me breathless. It\'s the fiercest performance I\'ve seen from one of the best actresses of our time and one of the best performances I\'ve seen in years.\n\nAs for the movie itself, really the less you know going in, the better. I saw the trailer two or three times prior to watching the film, and it did little to spoil the experience. I really do recommend going in blind, though.\n\nI don\'t rate many movies a 10/10. I also rarely leave theaters feeling the way I felt last night: dizzy on the possibilities of cinema and lost in thought over all I had just experienced. Even as I write this, I cannot wait to see the movie again with new people so they can experience just how special this is.\n\nEverything, Everywhere dazzles with its creative vision, but it marries the bizarre and magical with the mundane and the ordinary to make a statement about human potential and how often we let our daydreams - what could have been, should have been, will or won\'t be - roadblock who we are. The movie obliterates the veil of ordinary to reveal the extraordinary, but it never loses itself within its relentless, wacky, metaphysical vision.\n\nQuite the contrary, really. When the dust settles by the end of the film, you feel like you have been taken somewhere new - to a place only the best films can take us - and are reminded that even though we might not matter in the grand scheme of the universe, there are kind things we can do - to one another and ourselves - to make the pain and joy of being human mean...something.\n\nAnd at the end of the day, maybe that\'s everything.'),(1631,95,'6/10','Bit incredulous at the amount of Oscars....','JBLOSS','13 March 2023','Firstly I should say I thought the actors did put in some very good performances and I can see why they were nominated although as to whether they deserved to beat some of their competitors is another matter.\n\nI have to say I found this film to be tedious and almost unenjoyable to watch. It feels like a film made for the TikTok generation - no overall coherence with nuggets of scenes rammed together. Is this a film I would ever bother watching again - absolutely not.\n\nYes it is different - in much the same way The Artist was (and who talks about that film anymore?) but that doesn\'t make it good. It aims for a profound message whilst its style is overwhelmingly superficial. It\'s a film with little artistic merit or dare I say beauty (I am talking about the scenes and cinematography here not the actors) and it definitely did not move me except to pray it was going to finish.\n\nIn short it barely ticks the boxes of what I\'d consider to be essential criteria for a great movie. Maybe this is the first of a new wave of this type of film and I am not getting it but when it had finished I felt pretty much nothing.'),(1632,95,'9/10','A beautifully unique exploration of nihilism','orriansylvesterarnold','26 March 2022','Wow, what a movie.

The setting of this movie was indeed a more accurate representation of an Asian American household. The family dynamics sounds about right. I like that Asians are getting more spotlight.\n\n2. The concept/theme of this movie is rather novel and therefore interesting. Although I think it could have been played out much more sophisticatedly.\n\n3. The parent-child relationship is well portrayed. The perceived lack of validation from parents felt by the child, the poorly communicated love of the parent, the process of gaining awareness and emotional growth for both the parent and child is inspiring.\n\nThings I didn\'t like 1. It is a very bizarre movie, you could even say chaotic. It\'s as if they tried to combine every single meaningless detail together and gave up filtering out what\'s actually worth or necessary to the main plot. Tried too hard to make it funny/original/emotional/relatable that it ends up being neither of those things very well.\n\n2. The movie is also unnecessarily long.\n\nThose two points combined makes this movie just a long, confusing, and sometimes boring mess. The novelty makes it watchable/bearable, but to me, it\'s nothing more than that.'),(1634,95,'SugarCottoncandy','Insufferable Intolerance All at Once','28 June 2022','Was this review helpful?

Sometimes too many things, too many places at once and you can get lost, but it helps to focus on things.\n\nObviously, the amazing Michelle Yeoh is one thing to focus on. The whole reason I myself came to see this flick in the first place. Much as this movie gives you to absorb it was easy to keep my eyes on the beautiful Yeoh.\n\nOh, and the kid from Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom is in this flick. He\'s older odiously but he still sounds like the kid form The Goonies. How lucky he was he got to play Yeoh\'s baby daddy in this joint.\n\nLast and definitely not least it was good to see James Wong in this film. You could tell they most likely made some filming adjustments to assure the 90 something year old actor can do the role but that\'s what you do when you have legends do your flick.\n\nSpeaking of legends, almost forgot about Jamie lee Curtis who seem like she was having fun in her role.\n\nThe fact that this movie is about a multiverse I low key was expecting a multiverse connection between who Yeoh plays in this movie, and her character in Shang shi. That would have been cool.\n\nIt\'s interesting that this like the third movie that came out in March that\'s about the mommy daughter relationship between Asian women. What\'s even more interesting is how they go in order. Turning Red is about a 13-year-old and Her mom, Umma is about an 18-year-old and her mom and the girl playing Yeoh\'s daughter looks like she\'s possibly in her early 20s. Don\'t know when this became a hot plot in movies, but I will admit I prefer how the story lays out here (but only because I relate more to an Asian woman in her 20s over a middle schooler)\n\nThe music in this film is great. The movie was filmed in the context that the story is about a laundromat owner in her mid-life dealing with where she came from and where she\'s going, but the music actually fits perfectly into the ideal of this woman being the key to saving the multiverse and it made for a lot of the entertainment. Just these big orchestra cues that make it sound like I\'m watching Dune contradicting, the image of Yeoh being a worn-out blue-collar mom. Spectacular!\n\nI say it\'s good. It\'s all over the place and it can be a handle to process, but it has a good cast to concentrate on.'),(1637,95,'9/10','Near Flawless Film','statuskuo','1 April 2022','Rarely does a movie hit me hard and I go along for the ride. Every moment has a spectacle to it. Even the simplicity of having your taxes done. Often silly, mostly confusing but entirely entertaining. It was great to see Short Round back on the big screen with a very glamoured down Michelle Yeoh as a married couple on the brink of fracturing a family unit.\n\nThe story is of, Evelyn, a woman who has never really committed to much in life. She has many interest but many where she isn\'t fully invested in. In this case, her family lives above the laundromat that is failing. They are being audited, but yet she has big dreams to expand her enterprise. Her husband (the fore mentioned Ke Huy Quan) Waymond, is a kindly follower and believer of his wife who seems to focus more on the bad than the good. Pessimist, if we are to be formal. It is the Chinese New Year, and many people are invited to celebrate with this family, including a Grand-Father who is labeled as a man set in his ways and wouldn\'t understand the same-sex relationship of his grandaughter Joy (Stephanie Hsu). What follows is a grand adventure, first at the IRS building (of all places) and eventually to distant alternate universes to which shows her the way her life may have gone had certain things didn\'t take place. I absolutely loved the fact that Jamie Lee Curtis plays the uptight auditor, who seems perfectly fine in the core universe to which all revolve around. Evelyn, on the other hand, taps into her other universes to gather the skills needed to fight a fracture in the timelines that sneak into her mundane life.\n\nYes, there is a message here. And...to be honest, it nearly derails the film itself. But it was required to tie in the meaning of everything that is going on. That we are made of experiences of every universe that exists out there (if you believe in metaphysics) and that they road you didn\'t take, through gained experiences, with some that even was more enticing then the present one, means we would never have known our other lives. Children wouldn\'t be born, love would be lost, relationships move on. It is the grand question of whether or not if we got a glimpse of that road we didn\'t take, would it all mean anything. In this case, I say it almost derails because the universes effect one another. And in this story, it even bridges them. Which to some, may feel like a cheat. However, the fact that I even ask this question makes it a vastly interesting story. That is for you to decide.\n\nThe movie is exciting, vibrant, energetic and feels absolutely unique. It allows the viewer to slowly tie the ends together, and perhaps sometimes gets too far ahead. But doesn\'t let you lose yourself too much. What it isn\'t is boring. It is captivating and fresh. And, look, who can hate a scene of people being beaten with rubber phalluses?\n\nThat said, it is one of the most interesting movies of 2022 and hopefully stays in the minds of awards in the future. Because it deserves a bigger audience. These are the types of fun, philosophical questions buoyed by comedy that we need.\n\nI go back to Ke Huy Quan. This guy can do funny and also bring a tug to your heart so easily. It\'s so hard to imagine him as the little boy from \"Indiana Jones And The Temple Of Doom\" because, here he shows so much range. His natural charm is shown through his love for Evelyn. He seems to be suffering through a fracture himself. He plays many roles here as well. Because, in many universes in life, the theory here may be that we will run into people we are meant to run into regardless of choices. That\'s a very romanticized view on the universe.\n\nKudos to The Daniels for their talent and joy of cinema. It would not surprise me if they helm a larger film in the future. Perhaps they can re-vamp a comic book franchise into something much more unique.\n\nThank you for this movie.'),(1638,95,'6/10','One word: OVERRATED.','thriller08','20 April 2022','Having seen countless raving reviews about this movie both on IMDb, and even more so on Twitter, I thought \"damn, I have to go see this ASAP\".

What\'s so uncool about movies with messages anyways? Sometimes we desperately need them. I read a couple of reviews lightly mocking any attempt to find deeper meaning amid all the silliness, as if there wasn\'t enough already on the surface. What if we stopped equating tiny with insignificant? What if the more minuscule we discovered ourselves to be, the LARGER our world became, and the more SIGNIFICANT we felt? So it\'s not surprising that Daniels take us on the most inventive, overstuffed, relentless journey only to land us in the simplest, most heartfelt of places. That\'s the real judo-move here -- an infectious, goofy sweetness that extends even to the (hundreds? Thousands?) of action set pieces. Anyone can dimension-hop and fight the baddies. This combination of heart and spirit is the Daniels own. Also, for anyone who\'s putting together the next time capsule of human civilization, please consider the scene of Michelle Yeoh and Jaime Lee Curtis dancing with wiener fingers.\n59 out of 108 found this helpful.

When one has someone playing multiple characters in multiple settings, there needs to be something tying it together. The protagonist needs to be someone we identify with who has wishes and hopes that lead us on. She seemed as confused as the storyteller and the husband. I guess I\'ll read some more about this film and hope with guidance to try to figure it out a bit. Obviously, all these universes and all this actions (way too much battling in my estimation) are leading somewhere. I thought the film had ended about six times. I don\'t mind being brought back in, but I wish I understood where we just landed. Yes, there is a lot going on and it is violently splashed on the screen.

Half of the time I don\'t know what are they fighting for or what the heck is going on. And what was supposed to be the multiverse just felt like the characters were wearing silly different costumes.

Then it does that loop again, faster and faster and faster, without ever losing the audience. I saw it in a packed theater, everyone laughing and crying and caring. Perhaps most amazingly, this was a pretty simple and effective relationship story through it all. I don\'t know if I would rather watch it again right now or watch a documentary about how the film took shape. Either way, I\'m glad it exists.

Amid the pageantry and intrigues of medieval Jerusalem, he falls in love, grows into a leader, and ultimately uses all his courage and skill to defend the city against staggering odds. Destiny comes seeking Balian in the form of a great knight, Godfrey of Ibelin, a Crusader briefly home to France from fighting in the East. Revealing himself as Balian\'s father, Godfrey shows him the true meaning of knighthood and takes him on a journey across continents to the fabled Holy City.

But Baldwin\'s days are numbered, and strains of fanaticism, greed, and jealousy among the Crusaders threaten to shatter the truce. King Baldwin\'s vision of peace--a kingdom of heaven--is shared by a handful of knights, including Godfrey of Ibelin, who swear to uphold it with their lives and honor. As Godfrey passes his sword to his son, he also passes on that sacred oath: to protect the helpless, safeguard the peace, and work toward harmony between religions and cultures, so that a kingdom of heaven can flourish on earth.
